    "title": "Q2: How does Basketball Related Income work?",
    "content": "Basketball Related Income” (“BRI”) for a Salary Cap Year means the aggregate operating revenues (including\nthe value of any property or services received in any barter transactions), received or to be received for or with\nrespect to such Salary Cap Year by the NBA, NBA Properties, Inc., including any of its subsidiaries whether\nnow in existence or created in the future (hereinafter, “Properties”), NBA Media Ventures LLC (“Media\nVentures”), any other entity which is controlled, or in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the issued and\noutstanding ownership interests are owned, by the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, and/or a group of NBA\nTeams.\nBRI example: Gate receipts and broadcast rights\nNew in the 2023 CBA\nLicensing\nFor the first time since the inception of the Salary Cap / Revenue Sharing system 40 years ago, team and\nleague licensing revenue from deals where players are not already directly receiving payment as part of the\ntransaction will be included in Basketball Related Income (BRI). This is expected to add approximately $160M\nto BRI in 2023-24, growing annually.\nBRI Improvements\nRevenue sharing formula will be enhanced in multiple ways, including with respect to the treatment of\ncomplimentary tickets, team watch parties, barter expenses, plaza naming rights, and treatment of equity\ntransactions. Under the negotiated formula for “Forecasted BRI,” players are again expected to receive 51% of\nBRI throughout the course of the agreement, resulting in a projected $250 million collective increase in\nSalaries and Benefits in the 2023-24 Season. Depending on the success of our business, players are expected\nto earn between $45-50 billion in Salaries and Benefits over the full 7-year term of the CBA.\n6\nTeam Audits\nThe maximum number of NBPA team audits will increase from 10 per year to an average of 15 per year. A\ntwo-year “lookback” effectively allows for the NBPA to adjust each year for all 30 teams. The NBPA also\ncontinues to have the right to audit the NBA league office annually. These audits are in addition to the annual\njoint NBPA/NBA comprehensive audit of all 30 teams by PricewaterhouseCoopers."

BRI and player costs for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear was:\nBRI                                                     $10.247 billion\nTotal Salaries                                         $5.256 billion\nTotal Benefits                                         $453 million\nTotal Salaries & Benefits (pre-reduction)               $5.709 billion\nPlayers’ Designated Share of BRI                        $5.226 billion\nas a percentage of BRI 51.0%\nOverage                                                 $484 million\nIf there is a shortfall (players didn’t receive 51% of BRI), the players will receive the full amount of\nescrow and a shortfall distribution from the NBA.\nTeams are entitled to recoup $484 million (i.e., the amount by which Total Salaries and Benefits\nexceeded the players’ Designated Share of BRI) via a 9.1%\nreduction to each player’s contracted salary.\nDuring the 2024-25 season, 10% of players' salaries were held in an escrow account. The total\namount came to $419 million. Because players received more than 51% of BRI, $419 million and an\nadditional $65 million was given back to teams. The additional money will be withheld from player\nsalaries.\nBelow is an example from 2017 when the players received 48.52% of BRI:\n8"

If the salary is stretched, the waiving team cannot re-acquire the player\nuntil the end of the original term of the contract.\nThe calculation is as follows:\nFrom a period of July until August 29 @ 5PM ET, a Team is allowed to aggregate and stretch the guaranteed\nsalary over the number of salary cap years equal to twice the number of seasons plus one.\nThe Formula:\n●     Player A has one-year and $10M left on his contract\n●     Team A elects to waive and stretch his contract prior to August 29 @ 5PM ET.

(Note that this modification will not apply to Contracts\nterminated prior to the first day of the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.)\nHow the rule works: Team elects to waiver Player A who has two years and $40 million left on his contract.\nUnder the prior CBA, the team had until August 29 to decide whether the salary owed is stretched over 5\nseasons. Under the new CBA, the team can elect to keep the first-year salary of $20 million counting against\nthe cap and then stretch the last year over three seasons (ex: $6.6 million).\nThe Uniform Player Contract (UPC) will be revised such that the $250,000 minimum threshold to stretch a\nplayer’s Salary will be (1) increased to $500,000 for cash purposes for all Contracts or Extensions signed\nbeginning on the first day of the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, and (2) eliminated for Salary Cap purposes.\n17"

Note: This is not\napplied to the team salary applied to the apron.\nExample\n● The NBA suspended Bobby Portis. The suspension cost Portis a total of $2.85M (1/110 of his salary\nmultiplied by 25). The Bucks received a tax variance credit that is applied to salary for $1,429,351.\nYears of Service\n● For any free agent with zero (0) Years of Service or one (1) Years of Service, the amount applicable of\na player with two (2) Years of Service.\n23\nExample\n● Justin Edwards has 1 year of service and signs a contract with Philadelphia. For luxury tax purposes,\n$2,296,274 (2 years of service) and not $2,048,494 (his salary), is applied to team salary that counts\ntoward the tax.\nBonuses\n● Any incentive bonus that was deemed unlikely before the season but then earned during the season\nwill apply toward salary that counts toward the luxury tax.\n● A team will also receive a tax variance credit for any incentive bonus that was deemed likely before the\nseason but not earned.\n● A trade bonus will count toward the luxury tax if a player is traded after the regular season.\nExample\n● Cameron Johnson had a $562,500 bonus that was considered unlikely during the 2024-25 season. The\nbonus was earned and Brooklyn had that amount apply to team salary towards the luxury tax. The\nbonus is now considered likely in 2025-26.\n● Jaden McDaniels had a $431K likely bonus in his contract before the 2024-25 season. McDaniels did\nnot reach the bonus and Minnesota had a $431K luxury tax variance credit. The bonus next season is\nnow considered unlikely. It still applies toward the apron.\n●   Player A has two years and $30M left on his contract ($15M for each season). He has a 15% trade\nbonus for unearned salary and is traded after the 2024-25 regular season but before July 1, 2025. The\nplayer will receive a $4.5 million trade bonus and $2,250,000 will apply to team salary for the 2024-25\nseason.\n24"

This occurred with\nBobby Portis and the Milwaukee Bucks’.\nCriteria: 2 years\nStarting salary: $14.29M (early bird exception-2025-26) or 175% of the previous salary\nLength: Must be a minimum of 2 years with no options. Maximum of 4.\nContract example: Malik Monk\nMonk signed a four-year $78M contract with Sacramento.\nThe first-year salary of $17.4M was 175% of his 2023-24 salary\nIf the player is an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, the new Player Contract must cover at least two (2)\nSeasons (not including a Season covered by an Option Year) and may provide in the first Salary Cap Year up\nto the greater of: (A) one hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of the Regular Salary for the final Salary Cap\nYear covered by his prior Contract, plus one hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of any Likely Bonuses and\nUnlikely Bonuses, respectively, called for in the final Salary Cap Year covered by the player’s prior Contract, or\n(B) Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses totaling an amount equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the Average\nPlayer Salary for the prior Salary Cap Year (or if the Audit Report for the prior Salary Cap Year has not been\ncompleted, one hundred five percent (105%) of the Average Player Salary for the prior Salary Cap Year as\ncomputed by substituting Estimated Total Salaries (as defined in Section 1(i) above) for Total Salaries). Annual\nincreases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses is a maximum of 8%. The maximum allowable years\nis 4.\nContract Example\nThe Lakers Austin Reaves signed a two-year $2.5 million contract in 2021.\nBecause Reaves was under contract for two years, early bird rights were established.\nReaves would go on to sign a four-year $53.8 million contract with the Lakers in the 2023 offseason.

For\nexample, Cam Johnson signed a four-year rookie contract with Phoenix in 2019.\nHe was then traded to Brooklyn in 2023 and his bird rights transferred to his new team.\nA player is also allowed to sign a 2 year and then 1 year contract to establish bird rights.\nA player that has bird rights with his original team but then is waived and eventually claimed, will now have\nearly bird rights with his new team.\nCriteria: 3 seasons (can change teams in a trade)\nStarting Salary: Up to 25, 30 or 35% of the salary cap based on years of service\nLength: Minimum of 1 year and up to 5 years\nContract Example: Julius Randle\nRandle originally signed with New York in 2019.

The new rule\nnow cuts that down to 36 hours if the offer sheet is sent by 12pm ET. If the offer sheet is received after 12pm\nET, the team now has 60 hours to make a decision. For example, the Suns would have had 2 ½ days to decide\non the Deandre Ayton offer sheet that was signed in Indiana last offseason.\nThe ROFR Team ,upon receipt of the Offer Sheet, may exercise its Right of First Refusal.\nThe ROFR Team may match an Offer Sheet by using, as applicable, Room, a Veteran Free Agent Exception,\nor the Minimum Player Salary Exception. In order to match an Offer Sheet, the ROFR Team must have, as\napplicable, Room, a Veteran Free Agent Exception, or Minimum Player Salary Exception in an amount equal or\ngreater to the Salary plus any Unlikely Bonuses provided for in the first Salary Cap Year of the player’s\nContract at the time notice of the Team’s exercise of its Right of First Refusal is given and must continue to\nhave such Room or the applicable Exception at all times the First Refusal Exercise Notice remains in effect.\nAny Team may condition its First Refusal Exercise Notice on the player reporting for and passing, in the sole\ndiscretion of the Team (exercised in good faith), a physical examination to be conducted by a physician\ndesignated by the Team within two (2) days from its exercise of the Right of First Refusal. In connection with\nthe physical examination, the player must supply all information reasonably requested of him, provide complete\nand truthful answers to all questions posed to him, and submit to all examinations and tests requested of him.\nIf the player does not submit to the requested physical examination within two (2) days of the exercise of the\nRight of First Refusal, then the First Refusal Exercise Notice shall be deemed no longer to be conditioned on\nthe player reporting for and passing a physical examination and the following rules shall apply:\n(1) In its sole discretion, the ROFR Team shall have two (2) days following the conclusion of the two (2) day\nperiod to withdraw its First Refusal Exercise Notice. If the First Refusal Exercise Notice is timely withdrawn in\naccordance with the foregoing, such withdrawal shall have the following effects:\n71\n(A) The Offer Sheet shall be deemed invalid and the Team that issued the Offer Sheet shall be\nprohibited from signing or acquiring the player for a period of one (1) year from the date the First\nRefusal Exercise Notice was withdrawn; provided, however, that if the ROFR Team subsequently\nrelinquishes its Right of First Refusal (resulting in the player becoming an Unrestricted Free Agent),\nthen the aforementioned one-year prohibition shall be deemed to expire on the last day of the Salary\nCap Year in which the invalidated Offer Sheet was signed by the player and the New Team;\n(B) The player shall be prohibited from entering into an Offer Sheet with any other Team prior to the\nfirst day of the Salary Cap Year immediately following the Salary Cap Year in which the invalidated\nOffer Sheet was signed by the player and the New Team.\n(C) If the deadline by which the player was given to accept the Qualifying Offer (and, if applicable,\nMaximum Qualifying Offer) provided to him by the ROFR Team has not already expired, then such\ndeadline shall be deemed to have expired (which shall have the effect of the player no longer being\nable to accept the Qualifying Offer (or, if applicable, Maximum Qualifying Offer) given to him by the\nROFR Team); and\n(D) (i) The player shall be prohibited from entering into any Player Contract with the ROFR Team other than a\nPlayer Contract containing all of the Principal Terms (but not any terms other than the Principal Terms)\nincluded in the Uniform Player Contract attached to the invalidated Offer Sheet (except that such Player\nContract may contain an Exhibit 6) before the later of (A) three (3) months following the date the ROFR Team\nwithdrew its First Refusal Exercise Notice, and (B) the January 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which the\ninvalidated Offer Sheet was signed by the player and the New Team.\nExample\nBack in 2016, Donatas Motiejunas and the Brooklyn Nets agreed on a four-year $37 million offer sheet ($6\nmillion of the bonuses however did not count for matching purposes because they were not generally league\nrecognized honors).\nThe Rockets eventually matched but here is where things got interesting.\nMotiejunas failed to show up for his physical in Houston, prompting the Rockets to pull their right of first refusal.\nMotiejunas went back to being a restricted free agent, unable to sign in Brooklyn for a period of one year.\nThe Rockets eventually withdrew their Qualifying Offer, allowing Motiejunas to become an unrestricted free\nagent.\nHe would go on to sign a one-year $577K contract in New Orleans.\n72"

    "content": "If an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent with two (2) Years of Service receives an Offer Sheet, the player’s\nPrior Team may use the Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent Exception to match the Offer Sheet even if the\nteam does not have cap space.\nThe rule is called the Arenas provision and below is the breakdown of the rule and how it could have impacted\nthe Lakers in 2023.\nGilbert Arenas was drafted in the 2001 second round by Golden State, signed a two-year, $924,000 contract\n(yes that was the total), won NBA Most Improved Player in 2002-03 and later entered the 2003 offseason as a\nrestricted free agent.\nHowever, because Golden State was over the salary cap and Arenas signed a two-year contract in 2001, the\nWarriors were not allowed to match an offer sheet that exceeded the $4.9 million Early Bird exception in the\nfirst season.\nArenas would sign a six-year, $66 million offer sheet with the Washington Wizards.\nRealizing that teams over the salary cap were disadvantaged in retaining their own Early Bird restricted free\nagents, the NBA addressed this rule in the 2005 CBA.\nThe \"Arenas rule\" prevents a team from offering a first-year salary in an offer sheet that exceeds the non-tax\nmid-level exception ($12.8 million in 2024-25) even if they have cap space.\nIf this rule had been in place in 2003, the Warriors could have matched Arenas' offer sheet because the $4.9\nmillion Early Bird exception was greater than the $4.6 million tax midlevel.\nThis leads us to Reaves and the Lakers.\nThe Lakers had Early Bird rights on Austin Reaves, who had his two-way contract converted to a two-year deal\nas a rookie in 2021.\nLos Angeles was allowed to offer a contract with a first-year salary of up to $12.6 million (estimated average\nplayer salary).\nIf Reaves signed (which he did) an Early Bird deal, it will have to be for at least two years, not including any\noption years. The maximum he could be signed for is four years, $53.8 million.\nHere's where things could have gotten interesting in a potential Reaves sweepstakes:\nA team with cap space could backload a multiyear offer, giving him a significant raise in the third and fourth\nyears.\nThis scenario played out in 2016, when the Brooklyn Nets signed Tyler Johnson to a four-year, $50 million offer\nsheet. Johnson's $5.6 million and $5.9 million salary (the non-tax mid-level in Year 1) in the first two seasons\nincreased to $19.2 million in the third and fourth years.\n73\nOne example of such a deal for Reaves -- from a team that had $20 million in cap space -- would have looked\nlike this:\n2023-24 -- $12.4 million (non-tax midlevel)\n2024-25 -- $13.4 million\n2025-26 -- $27.1 million\n2026-27 -- $27.1 million\nTotal -- $80 million\nAverage -- $20 million (cap space available)\nBecause cap space is used, a team such as the San Antonio Spurs would have been allowed to average the\ncontract over the four seasons.\nLos Angeles would have the right to match the offer sheet but would not be permitted to average out his\ncontract because it is over the salary cap, setting up Reaves to be one of the highest-paid shooting guards\nstarting in 2025.\nFortunately for the Lakers, no team offered Reaves an Arenas provision contract.\nA team that has only the $5 million tax mid-level exception and a restricted free agent with non-bird rights is not\nprotected by the Arenas provision."

The maximum years he can sign with Houston is\n3 and with another team 3.\nHow the Over 38 rule is applied\nIf a player is 37 years or older and signs a four-year contract with his current team, the Over 38 rule will apply.\nStarting with the 4th season, because the player will be 38 or older at the time of that season, all remaining\nseasons are treated as \"Zero Year\" seasons and become deferred over the first 3 seasons.\nAccording to the Over 38 Rule, 2026-2027 (the 4th year) becomes the \"Zero Year\" in this example and is\ndeferred on a pro rata basis to the prior Salary Cap Years. The signing team must have room for the Total\nSalary in 2023-2024, including the deferred Over 38 portions."

For purposes of this rule: (a) an Under-Fifteen Game\nfor which a Team has one Two-Way Player on its Active List will count as one Under- Fifteen Game; (b) an\nUnder-Fifteen Game for which a Team has 2 Two-Way Players on its Active List will count as two\nUnder-Fifteen Games; and (c) an Under-Fifteen Game for which a Team has three Two-Way Players on its\nActive List will count as three Under-Fifteen Games.\nSuspensions\n81\nWhen a Two-Way Player is suspended by the NBA, his NBA team, the G League, or his G League team, his\nCompensation will be reduced to 1/145th if fewer than 20 games, 1/110 if 20 games or more, 1/174 if the\nsuspension is for 1 game.\nBase Compensation Protection\nA Two-Way Contract that is signed prior to the start of the Regular Season may provide:\nFor aggregate Base Compensation protection of (a) for the 2025- 26 Season, up to $85,300 (an increase from\n$50,000 under the current CBA), and (b) for each subsequent Season, up to an amount equal to the maximum\namount of aggregate Base Compensation for the prior Salary Cap Year increased at the rate of growth in the\nSalary Cap; and\nThat the Base Compensation protection for a Season will increase to up to 50% of the Base Compensation\nprovided for in the Contract for such Season if the team does not request waivers on the player by a date that\nis on or after the first day of the applicable Regular Season.\nA Two-Way Contract that is signed during a Regular Season may provide for Base Compensation protection\nfor the Season during which it is signed of up to 50% of the Base Compensation provided for in the Contract\nfor such Season.\nSigning Deadline\nThe January 15 signing deadline for a Two-Way Contract will be moved back to March 4.\nSigning Restrictions\nThe limit set forth in aggregate future Base Compensation protection in a Contract between a team and player\nthat will result in a restriction on the player signing a Two-Way Contract with the team or playing under a G\nLeague contract for the team’s G League affiliate will increase (a) for the 2025-26 Season, from $77,500 to\n$85,300, and (b) for each subsequent Season, at the rate of growth in the Salary Cap.\nSalary Continuation\nThe separate rules for Two-Way Contracts related to the payment of unearned Based Compensation of the\nUPC will be eliminated and, instead, the rules that apply to a Two-Way Player’s right to receive payment of\nunearned Base Compensation in the event his Contract is terminated will be the same as those that apply to a\nplayer whose Standard NBA Contract is terminated.\nRestricted Free Agency\nThe rule that a Two-Way Player be on the Active or Inactive List for 15 days during the Regular Season in\norder to be eligible for a Qualifying Offer will be eliminated.\nExclusive Negotiating Rights and Exhibit 10 Contracts\nA player will not be permitted to sign an Exhibit 10 Contract while under a Two-Way Contract.\n82\nInternational Player Payments\nA team and player will not be permitted to enter into a Two-Way or Exhibit 10 Contract for one year after the\nteam entered into an agreement to make an international player payment on the player’s behalf.\nPlayoffs\nA player on a Two-Way contract is ineligible for the playoffs."

However, because Tatum did not earn All-NBA in 2020-21, his salary in the first year\nwas 25% of the salary cap.\nEvan Mobley was named DPOY Cade Cunnigham All-NBA. Both will earn 30% of the salary cap in the first\nyear. Their extension will increase from $224M to $269M.\nDesignated veteran extension\nYears of Service and Performance Criteria\nPlayers with one year or two years left on their contracts who have seven or eight years of service in the\nleague and have never changed teams (other than, if applicable, by being traded during their first four seasons\nin the league), and who meet certain performance criteria (see below), will be eligible to negotiate a veteran\nextension covering six total years (five new years if one year remains on the current contract or four new years\nif two years remain on the current contract).\nWaiting Period\nDesignated Veteran Player Extensions can be signed no sooner than the third anniversary of the signing of the\ncontract.\nOff-Season Signing Period\nDesignated Veteran Player Extensions can only be negotiated and signed during the off-season (i.e., from July\n1 through the day prior to the first day of the regular season).\nSalary\nDesignated Veteran Player Extensions will be required to provide for a first- year salary of at least 30% and no\nmore than 35% of the Salary Cap (under the 2023 CBA, such players’ applicable maximum first-year salary is\n30% of the Salary Cap).\nPerformance-Based Criteria\nFor purposes of qualifying to negotiate for the Designated Veteran Player Extension described above or the\nmaximum salary for certain free agents described in section B.4 below, a player will have to meet at least one\nof the following performance criteria at the time of signing:\n89\n● the player was named to the All-NBA first, second, or third team, or was named Defensive Player of the\nYear, in the immediately preceding season or in two of the immediately preceding three seasons.\n● The player was NBA MVP during one of the preceding three seasons.\nAny player who is extended pursuant to these criteria cannot be traded for one year from the date of signing.\nContract example\nJaylen Brown had 7 years of service entering the 2023 offseason and was named All-NBA for the 2022-23\nseason. Brown has reached the years of service and performance-based criteria and is now eligible to sign a\nfive year and up to 35% of the 2024-25 salary cap extension.\nHis teammate Jayson Tatum was named All-NBA in 2021-22 and 2022-23. Tatum has reached the\nperformance-based criteria but has six years of service currently. This same situation occurred with Shai\nGilgeous-Alexander in the 2024 offseason.\nBecause he reached All-NBA in two of the three preceding seasons (2021-22, 2022-23), Tatum was eligible to\nsign the Designated Veteran Extension in the 2024 offseason even if he did not reach the All-NBA criteria in\n2023-24.\nVeteran extension\nA player that signs a 3-year and 4-year contracts may be extended after the second anniversary of the signing\nof the original contract.\nExample: Dorian Finney Smith signed a three-year $12 million contract with Dallas in 2019. Finney-Smith was\neligible to sign an extension starting in the 2021 offseason.\n5-year contracts may continue to be extended only after the third anniversary of the signing of the original\ncontract.\nExample: In 2021, Julius Randle had one year left on his contract and signed a four-year extension. He is\neligible to sign an extension on the third anniversary (2024 offseason).\n● The maximum length is 5 years (including any years remaining on the current contract).\n● The maximum salary of the first year of the extended term is the greater of 140% of the player’s Salary\nin the last year of the contract or 140% of the Estimated Average Player Salary.\n● Extensions signed more than 1-year prior to the expiration of the original contract may only be executed\nduring the offseason.\n90\n● A player with one year left on his contract or a player/team option in the second season, can sign an\nextension up until June 30.\n● A player that has two years left on his contract (not including an option), has until the day prior to the\nstart of the regular season to sign an extension.\n● A player can include a trade bonus in an extension.\n● A Contract that is amended to waive all or any portion of a trade bonus in connection with the trade of a\nPlayer Contract may not be subsequently extended until the later of (i) six (6) months from the date of\nthe trade.\nThe following rules apply to all Extensions other than Extensions entered into in connection with a trade:\nFor each Salary Cap Year covered by an Extension after the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended\nterm, the player’s: (A) Salary, excluding Incentive Compensation, may increase or decrease in relation to the\nprevious Salary Cap Year’s Salary, excluding Incentive Compensation, by no more than eight percent (8%) of\nthe Salary for the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term of the Contract; and (B) Regular Salary\nmay increase or decrease in relation to the previous Salary Cap Year’s Regular Salary by no more than eight\npercent (8%) of the Regular Salary for the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract.\nIn the event that the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term of a Contract provides for Incentive\nCompensation, the amount of each bonus included in the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term may\nincrease or decrease in each subsequent Salary Cap Year by up to eight percent (8%) of the amount of such\nbonus in the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term.\nIn the event that the first Salary Cap Year covered by a Contract provides for Incentive Compensation, the\namount of each bonus included in the first Salary Cap Year of the Contract may increase or decrease in each\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year by up to eight percent (8%) of the amount of such bonus in the first Salary Cap\nYear of the Contract.\nRecent extension: The Hawks extended Dejounte Murray four-years $111 million with an additional $9.3\nmillion in likely/unlikely bonuses. Atlanta was allowed to include a trade bonus of 15% in the extension.

Under the new CBA, Holiday declined the option and signed for\n$30 million in the first year of the extension.\nExtension chart\n92"

    "content": "The league office is available to take trades over the weekend and on holidays. Trades submitted to the league\noffice over the weekend or on holidays will be conducted as soon as practicable, consistent with the need to\nensure the accurate processing of trades in compliance with all applicable rules. Given the complexity and\nsignificance of many trades teams conduct and the range of issues that can surface in connection with the\nleague office’s review of such trades, teams wishing to ensure the ability to complete a trade on a weekend or\nholiday are encouraged to continue to provide the league office with notice of the trade in advance of the\nimpending weekend or holiday.\nNo player may be traded during a game (NBA or G League) for which the player is dressed to play. In addition,\nwhen scheduling a trade call with the league office, any NBA team trading a player who has been assigned to\nthe G League must advise the league office of such a G League assignment.\nNo trade shall be effective until all terms and conditions of the trade are disclosed and agreed to during a\nconference call with the league office.\nRequired Health and Insurance-Related Information\nPrior to a trade call, teams that are parties to a trade are required to exchange by email (with a copy to the\nleague office) the health disclosures required. If information concerning the cardiovascular health (including as\nreflected in any echocardiogram report available in the league wide EMR) of the player whose contract or draft\nrights are being assigned is required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 4.03 of the By-Laws, the team must\nmake the disclosure required under Section 4.03 notwithstanding that there is no separate disclosure\nrequirement for all echocardiograms in respect of a player who is traded. Moreover, it is important for player\nhealth purposes that teams carefully review, for each player whose contract or draft rights the team acquires,\nthe echocardiogram reports available in the EMR and continue to upload echocardiograms to the EMR in\naccordance with the annual memo regarding EMR recording and uploading.\nWith respect to trades involving a player’s draft rights, unless waived by the assignee team with respect to a\nparticular player, the obligation to disclose relevant health information on the trade call contained in Section\n4.03 of the By-Laws applies not only to players whose contracts are being traded, but also to players whose\ndraft rights are being traded.\nTo facilitate the efficient trading of a player’s draft rights while still ensuring that assignee teams receive all\nrequired health information, a team trading a player’s draft rights is not responsible for providing to the\nassignee team any information that is available to all teams through a current or former Draft Combine “team”\n98\nsection of the EMR. Instead, disclosure of such information by the assignor team to the assignee team is\ndeemed to have occurred by virtue of the availability of such information to all teams through the EMR.\nHowever, if the assignor team has any relevant health information that is not available to all teams through the\nDraft Combine section of the EMR (e.g., by virtue of information collected at a team’s pre-Draft workout), then\nthe assignor team must disclose such information to the assignee team (unless such disclosure is waived by\nthe assignee team) in accordance with usual procedures. As always, teams also are prohibited under the\nBy-Laws from failing to disclose any other material information (or make any other material misrepresentation)\nduring the trade call.\nThe above-described rule regarding information contained in the Draft Combine section of the EMR applies\nonly to the trading of a player’s draft rights. In any trade of a player who is under contract to an NBA team, the\nassignor team remains responsible for disclosing all required information (including but not limited to all\nrelevant information with respect to the player in the EMR).\nOne or more teams may waive the right to receive health disclosures on one or more players (e.g., during and\nshortly following the Draft, teams typically waive their rights to receive health disclosures in respect of players\nfrom that Draft whose draft rights the team is acquiring).\nIn addition to the disclosure of health-related information, prior to a trade call teams that are parties to a trade\nare also required to exchange by email (with a copy to the league office) certain insurance-related information.\nThis information includes: (i) whether the player is enrolled in the League Wide TTD insurance program, and, if\nso, whether the coverage of the player is subject to any special medical exclusions, and information regarding\nany life, disability, or other insurance coverage that the team has purchased with regard to its players outside\nof the League Wide TTD insurance program or the League Wide accidental death and dismemberment\ninsurance program.\nNOTE: If an assignor team has purchased any life, disability, or other insurance coverage with regard to the\nplayer outside of the league wide TTD insurance program and the league wide accidental death and\ndismemberment insurance program, the assignee team may elect to have one or more of such insurance\npolicies assigned to it. If the assignee team so elects and notifies the assignor team in writing with a copy to\nthe league office within 30 days of the date of the trade call, the assignor team shall assign to the assignee\nteam the requested policies (if assignable). If any of such policies are assigned to the assignee team, the\nassignee team shall reimburse the assignor team for the pro-rata portion of any premiums paid by the assignor\nteam relating to the period following the trade and before the assignment of the policies. If proceeds from any\nrequested policy become payable to the assignor team prior to the assignee team’s election to receive the\ncoverage and/or prior to the assignment of the coverage to the assignee team, then the assignor team shall\npay the proceeds to the assignee team.\nA trade call will not be scheduled until all necessary disclosures have been reduced to writing and exchanged\nby the parties with a copy to the league office. In addition, if a trade requires the consent of a player whose\ncontract is being traded, then the trade call will not be scheduled until the league office has received the\nplayer’s signed written consent.\n99\nNOTE: The league office will periodically review the rules governing the disclosure of health and insurance\ninformation for trade calls in order to ensure disclosure of such information as required by the By-Laws,\nincrease efficiency in the trade process, and promote secure management of player health information.\nDuring the Conference Call\nParticipants will include a representative of each of the teams making the transaction and a representative of\nthe NBA Legal Department.\nThe parties will recite the terms of the transaction to which they had previously agreed.\nIf a player contract is involved, the NBA representative will review with the parties limited contract information\nand then confirm that each team has reviewed in full all exhibits of and amendments to (and is aware of the\nsalary cap-related information available in PCMS related to) the contract(s) it is acquiring. If a team has any\nquestions or would like clarification regarding the terms of any contract being assigned, the team may ask\nquestions or seek clarification prior to or during the trade call. Any contract terms that are subject to specific\npoints of agreement between the parties (for example, the details of a player’s deferred compensation payment\nschedule in circumstances where the teams must agree on the timing of the particular payments that each\nteam will make) will be discussed on the call.\nEach assignor team will be responsible for confirming on the trade call that there are no terms of the\ncontract(s) of the player(s) it is assigning other than those set forth in the contract(s) as shown in PCMS or\nreviewed on the trade call. In accordance with Section 4.04 of the By-Laws, should any such contract terms\nexist and not be disclosed by the assignor team on the trade call they will remain the obligation of the assignor\nteam.\nIf a player contract is assigned during the Regular Season, the salary of the player so assigned (including\nrelated payroll taxes) shall be apportioned on a per diem basis utilizing the entire number of days in the\nRegular Season, without regard to playoff games or exhibition games. The assignor team shall be responsible\nfor the portion of the salary through the day of the assignment, and the assignee team shall be responsible for\nthe salary after said date. If, however, the player dresses in a game for the assignee team on the date of the\nassignment, then the assignee team shall be responsible for the salary on that date. The foregoing may be\nmodified by agreement of the parties, however, any such agreement with respect to salary reimbursement will\nbe included when determining whether the teams participating in the trade are compliant with the cash\ntransfers rule (as discussed in Paragraph E.1.a above).\nNOTE: Unless altered by agreement of the parties on the trade call, any “adjusting payments” necessary to\nhave each team meet its obligation to pay the salary of the player(s) it is trading through the date of the trade\nas set forth in Section 4.04(a) of the By-Laws will be due within 30 days of the date of the trade call.\nIn order to facilitate efficient processing of trades and consistent treatment of life insurance reimbursement\nobligations, if a team assigns a player contract containing a life insurance reimbursement provision, then any\nrequired reimbursement pursuant to the player’s contract will be the responsibility of the assignor or assignee\nteam, in accordance with the following:\n100\nThe assignor team shall be responsible for reimbursing the player if at the time of the trade call:\nIn accordance with the player’s contract, the player has provided to the assignor team evidence that he paid\nthe premiums for which reimbursement is sought; or\nThe assignor team has already reimbursed the player for the premiums for term life insurance for that season.\nThe assignee team shall be responsible for reimbursing the player if at the time of the trade call the player has\nnot yet been reimbursed or submitted evidence that he paid the premiums for which reimbursement is sought.\nFor trades that are conditional upon one or more of the assigned players each reporting to his new team and\nsuccessfully passing a physical, the teams will agree on the trade call on the date and time by which the\nassignee team must notify the league office and the other team(s) that each of the specified players has\nreported and passed a physical.\nNOTE: If a player fails to report and submit to a physical by the date and time agreed upon by the teams on\nthe trade call and, as a result, the player’s new team desires to rescind the trade, the new team must so notify\nthe league office and the other team(s) within 15 minutes after the date and time by which the player was\nrequired to report. Failure to provide such notice shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the requirement that\nthe player report and submit to a physical.\nIf a player reports and submits to a physical but then does not pass the physical and, as a result of the player\nfailing his physical, the new team desires to rescind the trade, the new team must so notify the league office\nand the other team(s) by the date and time agreed upon by the teams on the call. Failure to provide such\nnotice shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the separate requirement that the player pass the physical\nadministered by the new team.\nTeams are not required to read on the trade call the health disclosures that they are making in connection with\nthe trade. In order to meet its disclosure obligation under Section 4.03 of the By-Laws in respect of each player\nwhose contract (or draft rights) it is assigning, each team will be required to represent on the trade call that the\nhealth disclosures exchanged prior to the call satisfy the disclosure requirements of Section 4.03 of the\nBy-Laws. With respect to any player whose contract (or draft rights) the assignee team is acquiring, the team\nmay request, or the league office may in some cases require, that the assignor team read on the trade call the\napplicable health disclosures.\nThe NBA representative will ask appropriate questions designed to identify team responsibilities and\nunderstandings.\nImmediately following the trade call, one team involved in the trade is required to send an email to the league\noffice (the “confirming email”) outlining the terms of the trade and copying the other team(s) involved in the\ntrade. The other team(s) are then required to reply to the confirming email, again copying the league office and\nthe other team(s), to confirm whether the terms of the trade reflected in the confirming email are those to which\nthe teams agreed on the call. The teams will agree on the call which team will send the confirming email.\nPromptly following the conference call, the league office will send an email to the teams setting forth the\nconditions that must be satisfied in order for the trade to be consummated (e.g., passing of physical exams and\n101\nsubmission of required trade certifications). When all conditions have been satisfied, the league office will send\nan email to the teams advising them.\nNOTE: No player involved in the trade may play in any game or practice or engage in any conditioning or other\nphysical activity with his new team (or any G League team) until the teams have received the email from the\nleague office advising them that all conditions of the trade have been satisfied. In addition, no transaction\ninvolving any player in the trade may be made (e.g., placing a player in the trade on waivers or recalling such a\nplayer from a G League assignment) until the teams have received the email from the league office advising\nthem that all conditions of the trade have been satisfied.\nA memorandum to the file will be prepared by the league office representative on the call, which will set forth all\nterms and conditions of the transaction. This memorandum, with related attachments, will be provided to all\nparties, and a copy of the player contract(s) will be provided to the assignee team or teams.\nSection 4.03 of the By-Laws provides that no team shall misrepresent or fail to disclose during a trade call any\nrelevant information in its possession, custody, or control concerning the health of a player whose contract or\ndraft rights the team is assigning. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “relevant information” shall include\n“any information concerning current or prior injuries, illnesses, or other health conditions that could affect the\nplayer’s ability to play skilled basketball at any point during the player’s career.” Teams must take care to select\nand organize the health information being disclosed to ensure that the information is sufficiently detailed to\nmeet the standard set forth in Section 4.03 of the By-Laws, but not so detailed – for example, disclosures\nincluding extensive language copied verbatim or without regard to materiality from MRI reports, surgical notes,\nor other medical documents from the EMR – as to undermine the rule’s purpose of bringing relevant\ninformation pertaining to a player’s health to the attention of the assignee team. The league office will require a\nteam to revise disclosures that include extensive language that is not consistent with the above-described\nstandards.\nAs a reminder, there is a trade disclosure tool within the EMR that allows team EMR users to generate a trade\ndisclosure form for a player by pulling from the health-related records for the player maintained in the EMR and\nsupplementing those records with additional information, if any, that the team plans to disclose to comply with\nits trade disclosure obligation. Teams may, but are not required, to use the EMR tool to document its trade\ndisclosures.\nNo team shall make any material misrepresentation or fail to disclose any material information during the trade\ncall.\nIf any team is found, after a hearing before the Commissioner, to have violated Paragraphs E.2.i or j above, the\nteam shall be subject to penalty. Such penalty shall be within the absolute and sole discretion of the\nCommissioner and may include a fine (not to exceed $1,000,000), suspension of the offending employee,\nrescission of the trade, and/or forfeiture or transfer of the offending team’s draft choices.\nIf a player contract is involved, unless the parties agree otherwise, the assignor team will be required to\ncomplete the player assignment form for signature of the assignee-team. (If contracts are being traded by the\nteams to one another, the NBA representative on the conference call will ask which team will initiate the form.)\nThe assignment form, containing all signatures, must then be forwarded to the NBA Legal Department within\n102\n10 days after the conference call for approval by the Commissioner. Accordingly, the team responsible for the\npreparation of the form must send it to the assignee-team(s) for signature immediately following the\nsatisfaction of all conditions to the trade.\nIn any dispute relating to the transaction, the memorandum to the file prepared by the league office will be\ndeterminative."

Subject to the 7- Year Rule, the parties to a trade may agree that one or both\nteams involved in the trade will be permitted to exercise a one-time option to defer the conveyance or receipt of\na pick for one year only.\n120\nFor example, the following trade is permissible, even though it does not specify the precise year in which the\npick will be conveyed:\nTeam A conveys to Team B the least favorable of the 2023 second round picks that Team A currently\npossesses; provided, however, that Team A and Team B shall each have the option to defer the conveyance\nfor one year.\nIf Team A and/or Team B elect to defer the conveyance for one year, then Team A will convey its own 2024\nsecond round pick to Team B.”\nExample\nAs part of the Anthony Davis trade, New Orleans had the right to defer the 2024 Lakers first to 2025. The first\nwas deferred and eventually sent to Atlanta as part of the Dejounte Murray trade.\nLater acquired trades\nIt is not permissible for teams to trade future first round or second round picks that the team might acquire in\nsubsequent trade transactions. Thus, the following type of trade is not permissible:\n“Team A conveys to Team B one 2025 second round pick from among any that Team A currently possesses or\nsubsequently acquires in future transactions.”\nProtection based on draft position\nSubject to the 7-Year Rule and all other applicable rules (including rules relating to required minimum\nconsideration in trades), a team is permitted to convey a future draft pick that is “protected” based on the\nteam’s selection number in the Draft.\nFor example, the following trade is permissible, even though it does not specify the precise year in which the\npick will be conveyed:\n“Team A conveys its own first round draft pick to Team B in the first Draft in which such pick is not among the\ntop 14 picks in the Draft; provided, however, that if Team B does not receive a first round draft pick pursuant to\nthe foregoing in any of the Drafts from 2023 through 2029, then Team B will instead receive Team A’s own\n2029 second round draft pick.”\nIn addition, subject to all other applicable trade rules, it is permissible for a team to protect a draft pick that it\nacquired from another team in a prior trade and convey such draft pick in a subsequent trade, provided that: (i)\nthe team protecting the draft pick in such subsequent trade holds the rights to such pick unconditionally; or (ii)\nthe team protecting the draft pick in a subsequent trade previously held the rights to such pick unconditionally,\n121\nbut then entered into another trade pursuant to which the team may be obligated, subject to protection, to\nconvey the draft pick to another team.\nThe following are examples of permissible trades involving a team protecting a draft pick it acquired from\nanother team:\nAssume that, pursuant to the terms of a prior trade, Team A has acquired Team B’s 2024 second round pick\nunconditionally: “Team A conveys a 2024 second round draft pick (Team B’s own) to Team C provided that\nsuch draft pick is not among picks 31-45 in the 2024 NBA Draft.”\nAssume that the following trade occurs after the trade described immediately above (with no intervening\ntransactions related to Team B’s own 2023 second round draft pick): “Team A conveys a 2024 second round\ndraft pick (Team B’s own) to Team D, provided that such draft pick is not among picks 46-60 in the 2024 NBA\nDraft.”\nNote that a team may also provide for alternative consideration in the event that a traded draft pick is not\nconveyed due to protection; provided, however, that the year in which the alternative consideration would be\nconveyed is specified. For example, assume that, as a result of a prior trade, Team A holds the rights to Team\nB’s 2024 first round draft pick unconditionally: “Team A conveys a 2024 first round draft pick (Team B’s own) to\nTeam C, provided that such pick is not among the top 14 picks in the 2024 NBA Draft. If Team A does not\nconvey the 2024 first round draft pick (Team B’s own) to Team C pursuant to the foregoing, then Team A shall\ninstead convey to Team C the following two second round draft picks: (i) Team A’s own 2024 second round\ndraft pick, and (ii) Team A’s own 2025 second round draft pick.”\nStepien rule\n●   No team may trade a future first round pick if the result may be to leave the team without first round\npicks in any two consecutive future years.\n● This is permissible: From a prior trade, Team A does not have a 2026 first and are not allowed to trade\na 2027 first. However, they now acquire an unprotected 2026 first in a trade. Because the pick is\nunprotected, Team A is now allowed to trade a 2027 first.\n●   If Team A does not have a 2026 first round pick and only one 2027 first round pick (its own), then Team\nA is prohibited from trading its 2027 first round pick prior to the date of the 2026 Draft.\nGolden State Warriors example\n2026: Own\n122\n2027: Own\n2028: Own\n2029: Own\n2030: Own if 1-20 or to Washington if 21-30\n2031: Own\n2032: Own\nGolden State traded their 2025 first to Miami.

Voters for MVP, All-NBA Teams, Defensive Player of the\nYear, All-Defensive Teams, and Most Improved Player will be directed to consider a player’s aggregate\nperformance over the course of the Regular Season (taking into account the player’s total number of\ngames and minutes played) when making their selections.\nPositionless Voting\nAll-NBA and All-Defensive Team voters will be directed to vote for the most deserving players each season\nwithout regard to position (e.g., voting the top five such players to the All-NBA 1st Team, the next five to the\nAll-NBA 2nd Team, and the final five to the All-NBA 3rd Team).\n126\nNeither the IST Finals Game, Play-In Games, nor a Team’s or a player’s performance during any such games,\nshall be considered for purposes of determining whether, as a result of his achievement of agreed-upon\nbenchmarks related to a player’s performance as a player or the Team’s performance during a particular\nSeason"

Group Stage\n1. During the first two months of the Regular Season, all thirty teams will participate in the Group Stage.\nDuring this period, two days of each week will be designated for the playing of “Group Stage Games”\nand the only games played on such days will be Group Stage Games.\n2. Group Stage Games will be treated as Regular Season games for all purposes under the CBA. A\nteam’s record in Group Stage Games will determine whether the team qualifies for the Knockout Stage.\n3. Each team’s opponents in the Group Stage Games will be determined as follows:\nThe fifteen teams in each Conference will be divided into three groups of five teams each (for a total of six\ngroups of five teams each league wide). A team will play each of the other teams in its group in one Group\nStage Game during the Group Stage, for a total of four Group Stage Games per team.\nTeams will be placed in groups via a random drawing:\nPrior to the drawing, in each Conference each team will be placed into a “pot” based on its record in the prior\nRegular Season. The teams with the three best prior-Regular-Season records in a conference will be placed in\n“Pot 1” for its conference; the teams with the fourth through sixth best prior-Regular-Season records will be\nplaced in “Pot 2”; the teams with the seventh through ninth best prior-Regular-Season records will be placed in\n“Pot 3”; the teams with the tenth through twelfth best prior-Regular-Season records will be placed in “Pot 4”;\nand the teams with the thirteenth through fifteenth best prior-Regular-Season records will be placed in “Pot 5.”\nIn each Conference, one team from each pot will be randomly selected into each of the three groups in that\nConference (i.e., “East Group A,” “East Group B,” “East Group C,” “West Group A,” “West Group B,” and “West\nGroup C”).\nThe team with the best standing in Group Stage Games in each of the six groups will advance to the Knockout\nStage. Final standings in each group will be determined based on records in Group Stage Games. In the event\ntwo or more teams are tied within a group, the tie among the teams will be broken based on record in Group\nStage Games against each other and, if still tied, based on better net result of total points scored less total\npoints allowed in all Group Stage Games. These and additional tiebreakers will be confirmed by the NBA\nfollowing consultation with the Competition Committee.\n131\nA “wildcard” team from each Conference will also advance to the Knockout Stage. The wildcard team will be\nthe team from each Conference with the best record in Group Stage Games that finished second in its group.\nIn the event two or more teams are tied for the wildcard in a Conference, the tie among the teams will be\nbroken based on better net result of total points scored less total points allowed in all Group Stage Games.\nThese and additional tiebreakers will be confirmed by the NBA following consultation with the Competition\nCommittee.\nKnockout Stage\nEight teams will participate in the Knockout Stage, a phase of the tournament consisting of single-elimination\n“Knockout Games.”\nGames played in the first and second rounds of the Knockout Stage (the “IST Quarterfinals” and “IST\nSemifinals,” respectively) will be treated as Regular Season games for all purposes under the CBA (other than\nas set forth in the BRI section above). The “IST Finals Game” will not be considered a Regular Season game\nfor purposes of a team’s Regular Season record and a player’s or team’s performance in such game will not be\nconsidered for purposes of bonuses or conditional protection, but will be considered for purposes of\ndetermining whether the player has met the games played requirement for certain league honors, and certain\nrules that apply to Regular Season games.\nIn each Conference,(i)IST Quarterfinal games will be hosted by the two teams with the best record in Group\nStage Games, and (ii) the team with the best record in Group Stage Games will host the wildcard team. In the\nevent two or more teams are tied for the best record in Group Stage Games, the tie among the teams will be\nbroken based on better net result of total points scored less total points allowed in all Group Stage Games.\nThese and additional tiebreakers will be confirmed by the NBA following consultation with the Competition\nCommittee.\nTheIST Semifinals games and IST Finals Game will be played at a neutral site (i.e., not the home arena for any\nparticipating team).\nA player will not be eligible to participate in the IST Finals Game with a participating team unless such player\nwas on the team’s roster as of the start of the first scheduled IST Semifinals game.\nThe four teams that lose in the IST Quarterfinals will each play one additional Regular Season game during the\nKnockout Stage on days on which IST Semifinal games and the IST Finals Game are not scheduled.\nThe 22 teams that do not participate in the Knockout Stage will each play two Regular Season games during\nthe Knockout Stage on days on which Knockout Games are not scheduled.\nThe actual In-Season Tournament schedule for the 2023-24 Season will be established by the NBA by August\n2023 and, prior to the public announcement of the schedule, the Players Association will have the opportunity\nto provide the NBA with comments, which will be considered in good faith.\n132\nTournament Awards A. Prize Pool\nFor the 2023-24 Season, an In-Season Tournament Prize Pool will be allocated to the players on the teams\nthat participate in the Knockout Stage as follows:\n●   $500,000 to each player on the team that wins the IST Finals Game;\n●   $200,000 to each player on the team that loses the IST Finals Game;\n●   $100,000 to each player on a team that loses in the IST Semifinals; and\n●   $50,000 to each player on a team that loses in the IST Quarterfinals.\nFor each player, the amounts set forth above will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\nnumber of Knockout Games for which the player was eligible to play for the team and the denominator of which\nis the total number of Knockout Games played by the team. For the purposes of the calculation described in\nthis Section, an In-Season Tournament game for a which a player was eligible to play while under a Two-Way\nContract or a 10-Day Contract will count as one half of a game for which the player was eligible to play for the\nteam.\nThe amounts, if any, by which the prize amounts set forth above will grow annually are subject to further\ndiscussion between the parties.\nThe In-Season Tournament Prize Pool will be included each Season in the calculation of Benefits.\nLeague Honors\nEach year, players will be selected for the following league honors related to the In-Season Tournament: Most\nValuable In-Season Tournament Player and All-Tournament Team.

For clarity, a team will not have violated this\nconfidentiality restriction to the extent its discussion involves only public information regarding a player.\nIf the NBA has reason to believe that this confidentiality restriction has been violated, it will advise the Players\nAssociation in a timely manner.\nIf the Players Association determines that this confidentiality restriction has been violated, it may bring a\nproceeding before the System Arbitrator.\nUpon a finding by the System Arbitrator of a material violation, the System Arbitrator shall have the authority to\nimpose on any team found to have committed such violation a fine of up to $1,000,000. In considering an\nappropriate fine for a violation, the System Arbitrator shall take into account all relevant factors, including but\n137\nnot limited to the impact of the violation on the player, the degree of care demonstrated by the team, and any ill\nintent regarding the player.\nRanking NBA Prospects\nThe NBA and Players Association will agree upon, and include in the new CBA, a method to rank the top-10\nprospects prior to the Draft Lottery using a blend of publicly-available rankings, an appointed panel of experts,\nand a retained-scouting service.\nFitness-to-Play\nFor clarity, and consistent with current practice, nothing herein will limit the right of the NBA, Players\nAssociation, or a team to refer a player to a Fitness-to-Play Panel if advised by a physician that the player has\na potentially life-threatening injury, illness, or other medical condition that renders him medically unable and/or\nmedically unfit to perform his duties as a professional basketball player and/or that performing such duties\nwould create a materially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal injury for the player.\nShould the NBA, Players Association, or a team refer a player to a Fitness-to-Play Panel (e.g., if advised by\none of the cardiologists at the Combine that a player has a potentially life-threatening medical condition that\nwould create a materially elevated risk of death for the player), then the fact that the case was referred, the\nPanel’s determination, and related records will, in accordance with the Fitness-to-Play Panel process, be made\navailable to all 30 teams.\nPost-Draft Access\nBeginning on the day after the conclusion of the Draft, teams will no longer have access to league medical\nhistory/testing and medical examination results for any player whom they did not select in the Draft or whose\nDraft rights they do not hold.\nAgents at Combine\nTo promote players’ access to their representatives, certified player agents who represent players participating\nin the Combine will be (A) credentialed for the on-court portion of the Combine, and (B) able to reserve a room\nin the official Combine hotel block (agents will be required to pay for their own rooms).\nAdditional Consultation\nFollowing execution of the new CBA, the NBA will consult with the Players Association in good faith on (A)\ncreating a list of non-exclusive jointly-recommended interview questions to provide to NBA teams each year\nprior to the Combine and (B) any issues the Players Association raises relating to scheduling or operational\ndetails of the Combine (e.g., setting the dates and location of the Combine, elements of the player experience\nat the Combine).\n138\nPro Days\nPrior to the NBA Draft each year, teams will be prohibited from attending any workouts organized by\ndraft-eligible players or such players’ agents or representatives (e.g., “pro days”) other than those (A)\nconducted as part of the NBA Draft Combine (with such workouts scheduled by the NBA in coordination with\nthe Players Association); or (B) organized by the Players Association (in coordination with the NBA) in (1)\nCalifornia, and (2) a location on the East Coast, provided that the workouts conducted will, in each case, take\nplace in a single athletic facility over no more than a two-day period (provided, however, that in circumstances\nwhere conducting the workouts in a two-day period is impracticable, such workouts may, following discussion\nby the NBA and Players Association, be conducted over a three-day period). The NBA and Players Association\nwill continue to discuss whether the workouts conducted in California and on the East Coast may take place in\nNBA team facilities.\nAutomatic Eligibility\nA player will no longer be automatically eligible for the NBA Draft by virtue of rendering services to a non-NBA\nprofessional basketball team, and Article X, Section 1 will be revised to provide that such a player will be\nautomatically eligible for an NBA Draft if he is or will be 22 years of age during the calendar year of the Draft."

Embiid has to miss 25 or more regular-season games because of injuries to those areas, and\nplay fewer than 1,650 minutes, for Philadelphia to have the option of releasing him for cost savings.\nFor example, if Embiid hypothetically suffered a serious knee or wrist injury -- something outside the\ncontractual language surrounding the feet and back -- the 76ers would have no avenue to waive Embiid to\nreclaim any portion of his salary. And given Embiid's rare talent, there's a belief that he'd have to suffer a\ncareer-ending injury to inspire the 76ers to release him.\nIf Embiid met that narrow criteria and the Sixers decided to waive him after the 2018-19 season, he would\nreceive $84.2 million of his full contract; after the 2019-20 season, $98.2 million; after the 2020-21 season,\n$113.3 million; and after the 2021-22 season, $129.4 million.\n180\nWhat's more, if Embiid played a minimum of 1,650 regular-season minutes in three consecutive years during\nthe extension, or three out of four including the 2017-18 season, those benchmarks would eliminate the\npossibility of a reduction in the contract.\nThe first full season of Embiid's contract extension starts with the 2018-19 season and pays him $25.3 million,\na salary that escalates a standard 8 percent per year until the 2022-23 season.\nFor Embiid to reach the threshold of the super maximum contract criteria -- which would pay him 30 percent of\nthe salary cap and ultimately as much as $176 million -- Embiid must earn first-team All-NBA honors or be\nvoted the NBA's Most Valuable Player in the 2017-18 season.\nNote: The salary in each year does not decrease, only the protection amount if Embiid did not reach the sets of\ncriteria. Embiid met the injury criteria and the contract eventually became fully guaranteed."

    "content": "The CBA’s anti-collusion provisions generally prohibit “agreements” (express or implied) among teams that\nthey will not negotiate with or sign particular players or as to what contract terms will or will not be offered.\nViolation of the anti-collusion provisions of the CBA can have severe repercussions for both individual teams\nand the NBA. It is thus vital that teams proceed with caution in their communications regarding free agents,\nconsult team counsel and the NBA Legal Department with any questions, and adhere to the rules set forth in\nthis Section H.\nProhibited and Permitted Conduct.\n201\nNo team, or any of its employees or agents, may enter into any agreement, express or implied, with any other\nteam (i) to negotiate or to refrain from negotiating with any veteran or rookie, (ii) to submit or not to submit an\nOffer Sheet to any Restricted Free Agent, (iii) to offer or not to offer a player contract to a free agent, (iv) to\nexercise or not to exercise a right of first refusal, or (v) concerning the terms and conditions of employment\noffered to any veteran or rookie.\nThe CBA does not prohibit all communication among teams on the subject of free agent negotiations. Under\nthe CBA and league rules, the following communications are permitted:\nEach team’s Designated Negotiators (i.e.,the two persons designated as the only representatives of the team\nwho may conduct free agent negotiations, as discussed in Paragraph H.3 below) are authorized to\ncommunicate with the Designated Negotiators of any other team in order to verify or confirm claims that\nparticular offers have been made or promised to particular players. For example, if it is claimed that a player\nhas been offered or promised an offer of a particular salary or a particular range of salary, a team’s Designated\nNegotiators are permitted to contact the Designated Negotiators of the team that allegedly made the offer to\ninquire as to whether the offer was in fact made. This applies to claims about offers to any player, regardless of\nwhether the team is interested in signing that player. The purpose of this rule is only to ensure that teams can\nconduct their free agent negotiations on the basis of accurate and truthful information and will not be misled by\nfalse or exaggerated claims or reports.\nThe league office is prohibited from disclosing to any team that another team has negotiated with or is\nnegotiating with any free agent. The league office may discuss with any team its own negotiations with free\nagents and provide advice and assistance concerning the structuring of player contracts. However, the league\noffice may not pass on to other teams any information regarding a team’s negotiations with free agents.\nTeams may not enter into any agreement or understanding with respect to the signing and trading of a player,\nexcept in accordance with the “sign-and-trade” rules set forth in the CBA.\nTeams are prohibited from failing or refusing to negotiate or enter into a player contract with any player who is\nfree to negotiate and sign a contract with any team because that player: (i) has previously been subject to the\nexclusive draft rights obtained by another team in an NBA Draft; (ii) has previously refused or failed to enter\ninto a player contract containing an option; (iii) has become a Restricted or Unrestricted Free Agent; or (iv) is or\nhas previously been subject to a Right of First Refusal. This, of course, does not require a team to negotiate\nwith a free agent if it genuinely is not interested in his services.\nPenalties under the Anti-Collusion Rules\nIf collusion is found, the affected players will have the right to terminate their contracts and, in addition, the\nfollowing penalties will be imposed:\nThe first time a team engages in collusion, it will be required to pay double the amount of damages suffered by\nany player injured by the collusion.\nThe second time a team engages in collusion, it will be required to pay treble damages; and\n202\nIf a team engages in collusion more than twice, it will be required to pay treble damages, plus a fine of\n$4,000,000.\nIn addition to these specific penalties, the Players Association will have the right to terminate the entire CBA,\nupon a finding that:\nIn any one season, five or more teams have engaged in collusion and the collusion has affected five or more\nplayers; or\nIn any two consecutive seasons, seven or more teams have engaged in collusion and the collusion has\naffected seven or more players; or\nAt any time, 10 or more teams have engaged in collusion, even if only one player is affected."

    "content": "The CBA contains salary cap circumvention rules that prohibit teams from, among other things, paying any\nplayer for basketball services outside of the terms of his UPC, agreeing to enter into a future player contract, or\nundertaking any action that is designed to circumvent the intention of the parties as reflected in the CBA. As\npart of this broad prohibition, the circumvention rules generally prohibit teams from providing–or arranging for\nothers to provide – any compensation, benefit, or anything else of value to a player (or any person or entity\nrelated to a player, such as his agent) unless such compensation, benefit, or other value is included in the\nplayer’s UPC or otherwise expressly permitted under the CBA.\nThe following is a summary of the salary cap circumvention rules as set forth in Article XIII of the CBA. This\nsummary is intended only as a reference and is not meant to define the full meaning or scope of any provision\nin the CBA. Each team is responsible for reviewing the applicable provisions of the CBA in their entirety and\ntaking appropriate steps to ensure that all team representatives and affiliates are in compliance at all times with\nthese rules.\nProhibited Conduct\n(1) Under Article XIII, Section 2(a) of the CBA, a team is prohibited from entering into, among other things, any\nagreements, transactions, promises, undertakings, or understandings of any kind with a player that involve\n“compensation or consideration of any kind or anything else of value,” “an investment or business opportunity\nto be furnished or made available to the player,” or “any future Renegotiation, Extension, or other amendment\nof an existing Player Contract, or entry into a new Player Contract.” The general prohibition set forth above\nmeans that, among other things, teams and Team Affiliates are prohibited from providing – or arranging for\nothers to provide – potential investment or business opportunities to a player, including any free agent or\ndraft-eligible player, or any person or entity related to a player. As noted above, the circumvention rules also\nbroadly prohibit teams and Team Affiliates from providing a player, or any person or entity related to a player,\nwith compensation, benefits, or things of value beyond what is called for in the player’s UPC and the CBA.\n203\nThe above prohibition is very broad and is violated even absent any specific intention to provide compensation\nto a player or otherwise circumvent the salary cap. Even an attempt to enter into or solicit a relationship that is\nprohibited under Article XIII, Section 2(a) constitutes a violation of the prohibition.\n(2) Under Article XIII, Section 1(b) of the CBA, a team is prohibited from entering into an agreement or\nunderstanding with a sponsor, business partner, or any other third party under which the third party pays or\nagrees to pay compensation for basketball services to a player under contract to the team, even if such\ncompensation is ostensibly designated as being for non-basketball services.\n(3) Under Article XIII, Section 1(c) of the CBA, a team is prohibited from having a financial arrangement with or\noffering a financial inducement to any player (not including retired players) not signed to a current Player\nContract. Consistent with the foregoing, teams are prohibited from, among other things, paying an unsigned\nplayer to practice or work out with the team or paying or offering to pay compensation to an unsigned draft\nrookie or unsigned free agent in exchange for such player agreeing to participate in a summer league or a\nrookie camp. The only compensation that may be provided to a player participating in a summer league or\nrookie camp is as set forth in Section IV.A.3 of this Manual.\nAlso note that under the league’s salary cap circumvention rules teams are prohibited from providing – or\narranging for others to provide – potential investment or business opportunities to any international player (in\nconnection with the team’s attempt to secure rights to the player or otherwise).\nb. Applicability of Prohibitions. All of the above prohibitions apply to all team representatives. For this purpose,\n“team representatives” includes persons holding ownership interests in an NBA team, as well as all full-time or\npart-time personnel, officers, directors, employees, agents, or other representatives of the team, and whether\nclassified as “employee,” “consultant,” or otherwise. The prohibitions also apply to any other persons who are\ndirected or authorized to act by team representatives. The prohibitions also apply to all Team Affiliates (as that\nterm is defined in the CBA). The prohibitions also apply to players’ agents and representatives and any other\nperson or entity related to a player. The prohibitions also apply to contacts by a team with players employed by\nother teams (such contacts also may constitute tampering in violation of Article 35A(f) of the NBA Constitution;\nsee Paragraph D.1 above).\nTeams are responsible for taking all appropriate steps to ensure that all team representatives are in\ncompliance at all times with the above CBA and NBA Constitution provisions.\nc. Examples of Prohibited Conduct. Set forth below are examples of conduct that is prohibited under the\ncircumvention rules. Note that these examples are for purposes of illustration only and do not constitute an\nexhaustive list of conduct prohibited under such rules.\nExamples of Conduct Involving Investment or Business Opportunities That Is Prohibited Under the\nSalary Cap Circumvention Rules.\n(1) A team representative invests in a company that is related to a player, or a player invests in a company that\nis affiliated with a team representative.\n(2) A team representative helps a player gain access to an investment fund operated by a friend of the\nrepresentative.\n204\n(3) A team representative acquires an interest in a firm that represents NBA players.\n(4) A team representative’s non-NBA company engages a player to make promotional appearances on behalf\nof the company.\n(5) A team promotes or sells a product that is produced by a player’s business.\n(6) A team hires a player’s relative in a business, operations, administrative, or other similar role.\n(7) A business owned by a team representative’s spouse signs a player to an endorsement deal.\n(8) A team representative assists a player in negotiating or obtaining a product endorsement agreement with a\nsports apparel company.\n(9) A team representative recommends one of the team’s players to a team sponsor as a candidate for an\nendorsement arrangement. (If teams are approached by business partners or other third parties regarding a\npotential business relationship with a player, teams should respond solely by providing the third party with\ncontact information for the player and/or his agent.)\n(10) A team’s affiliated arena rents retail space in the arena to a player or a business owned by the player.\n(11) A team suggests to a local company that the company offer a player an opportunity to enter into a\nbusiness venture or agreement if the player signs a contract with the team.\n(12) A team sells a sponsorship to a business owned by a player.\n(13) A media business operated by a team representative enters into a partnership with a player or a business\nowned by a player.\n(14) A team employs a recently-retired player in a non-playing capacity (e.g., as a player development or\naffiliated G League coach) and subsequently seeks to re-sign the individual as a player.\nNOTE: Teams are allowed, subject to all CBA rules, to hire a recently retired player in a non-playing capacity;\nhowever, if a team does so, it will thereafter be prohibited from signing the individual as a player.\nExamples of Other Prohibited Conduct Under the Salary Cap Circumvention Rules.\n(15) A team representative pays a cash bonus to a player (not disclosed in the player’s UPC) upon the player’s\nsigning with the team.\n(16) A team representative promises a player who is currently under contract with the team that the team will\nsign the player to a new UPC once the player’s current contract expires.\n(17) At the time a player and team are negotiating the terms of a UPC, a team representative promises the\nplayer that the team will also sign the player (or another player – e.g., a player represented by the same agent)\nto a future UPC.\n205\n(18) A team makes payments or reimbursements to or on behalf of a player in respect of travel, lodging, or\nmeal expenses incurred in recruiting, negotiating, or signing the player in excess of that permitted under\nleague rules.\n(19) A team agrees to promote, help organize, or donate give-away items for a player’s for-profit basketball\nskills training camp.\n(20) A team’s coach pays a cash prize to players who win shooting contests during team practices or who\nrecover a certain number of loose balls in a game.\n(21) A team organizes and pays for a team-building activity or celebration in a non-business destination (e.g.,\nBermuda).\n(22) An executive of a company affiliated with a team representative makes a residence in the team’s home\ncity available to one of the team’s players.\n(23) A team representative takes a player to the Super Bowl at the representative’s expense.\n(24) A team representative recommends a player for membership in a private club (e.g., a country club\nmembership).\n(25) A team representative arranges, facilitates, or conducts any type of direct transaction with a player to\nprovide the player with goods or services (on a discounted basis or otherwise). The circumvention rules would\nprohibit, for example, players participating in a corporate employee discount program of a company owned in\nwhole or in part by a team representative or a team sponsor providing players with the sponsor’s products for\nfree.\n(26) A team representative allows a player use of a private aircraft (e.g., plane, helicopter, etc.) in\ncircumstances other than those expressly permitted by league rules. (Please refer to Paragraph I.2.b below for\ndetails.)\nPenalties\nPenalties for violating the circumvention rules include forfeiture of draft picks, a team fine of up to $7.5 million,\nsuspension of team personnel, and voiding of current and future player contracts between the team and any\nplayers at issue.\nA violation of the rules may be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence, but not limited to, evidence that a\nPlayer Contract or any term or provision thereof cannot rationally be explained in the absence of the conduct\nviolating the rules.\nReporting Requirements\n(1) Mandatory Circumvention Certification. The CBA requires a certification from each team that it has not\nviolated the circumvention provisions during the preceding season. Refer to Paragraph H.4 below for the\nrequired certification language.\n206\n(2) Solicitation of Unauthorized Benefits. Teams are required to report to the league office any solicitation by\na player of compensation or other benefits that are not authorized under the CBA. This includes any solicitation\nmade by a player himself, by the player’s agent, or by any other person acting (or purporting to act) on the\nplayer’s behalf. Reports must be made even if the solicitation is rejected. For purposes of this requirement, a\n“solicitation” includes a request, suggestion, demand, or any other communication that seeks an unauthorized\nbenefit, whether express or implied. Thus, for example, if a free agent tells a team representative that he will\nsign a player contract with that team if the team’s owner commits to invest in a business owned by the player, a\nreport would be required. Similarly, if a player’s agent tells a team representative that the player will demand a\ntrade unless the team pays the player a cash bonus outside the player’s UPC, a report would be required.\nReports must be made within 24 hours of the relevant activity.\n(3) Contact by Uncertified Player Representatives. Teams are required to report any contacts initiated on a\nplayer’s behalf by an uncertified player representative regarding contracts, transactions, or related matters.\nThus, for example, if a free agent’s friend (who is not a certified agent) contacts a team representative to\ndiscuss potential contract terms on the player’s behalf, a report would be required. Reports must be made\nwithin 24 hours of the relevant activity.\nAs a reminder, negotiating a player contract with an agent or representative who is not certified by the Players\nAssociation is prohibited under the CBA. The Players Association periodically provides the league office with\nupdated lists of players and the agents that represent them."

    "title": "Q122: What happens if a team, agent or player tampers?",
    "content": "Article 35A(f) of the NBA Constitution provides as follows:\n“No person may, directly or indirectly, (i) entice, induce, persuade, or attempt to entice, induce or persuade, any\nPlayer who is under contract to, or whose exclusive negotiating rights are held by, any other Member of the\nAssociation to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services or negotiate or contract for such services or\n(ii) otherwise interfere with any such employer-employee relationship (or prospective employer-employee\nrelationship in the case of a Player subject to exclusive negotiating rights) of any other Member of the\nAssociation. The Commissioner, either in his discretion or at the request of a Member who alleges that its\nPlayer has been tampered with, shall conduct an investigation into whether a person has violated the\nanti-tampering rule set forth in the prior sentence. In the event that, following such investigation and a hearing\nat which the person (and the Member employing the person allegedly tampered with) has an opportunity to be\nheard after due notice, the Commissioner determines that the anti-tampering rule has been violated, he shall\nhave the power, in his sole discretion, to impose a penalty for such offense, which penalty may include (without\nlimitation) the suspension of such person for a definite or indefinite period; the prohibition of the Member\nemploying or otherwise affiliated with the offending person from hiring the Player tampered with for a definite or\nindefinite period; the forfeiture of Draft picks held by the Member employing or otherwise affiliated with the\noffending person or the transfer of such Draft picks to the aggrieved Member; and/or the imposition of a fine\nupon the offending person and/or the Member employing or otherwise affiliated with such offending person in\n207\nan amount not to exceed $10,000,000. In the event that the Commissioner imposes a fine, he may direct that\nsome or all of the fine be paid directly to the Member aggrieved by the tampering.’’\nArticle 35A(e) of the NBA Constitution provides for a similar tampering prohibition covering coaches, trainers,\ngeneral managers, or any other person who is under contract to any team.\nThe anti-tampering rule contained in the NBA Constitution embodies a fundamental principle in a league of\npartners – namely, that employment contracts are to be respected and conduct that interferes with contractual\nemployment relationships is prohibited. This principle is particularly important in today’s media environment,\nwhere any actions or comments relating to potential player movement receive immediate and widespread\npublic attention. Teams should be entitled to focus their efforts on the competition with the players they have\nunder contract, without having to divert attention or resources to conduct or speculate regarding the potential\ndestinations of those players in future seasons once their contracts expire.\nThe scope of the anti-tampering rule is broad, and its application in any given case is based on all facts and\ncircumstances. Accordingly, conduct that does not violate the rule in any single instance may nevertheless\nconstitute a violation if it becomes repeated or part of a broader collection of improper actions. Teams should\ntherefore refrain from any conduct – including public statements – that could be viewed as targeting or\nexpressing interest in another team’s player.\nUnder Article 35A of the NBA Constitution, it is a violation of the league’s anti-tampering rule for any person\naffiliated with an NBA team to directly or indirectly (i) entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice, induce,\nor persuade, any player, coach, GM, or other person under contract to any other NBA team (or, in the case of\nplayers, whose exclusive draft rights are held by such team) to enter into negotiations for or relating to that\nperson’s services or to negotiate or contract for such services, or (ii)otherwise interfere with the\nemployer-employee relationship (or prospective employer-employee relationship in the case of a drafted\nplayer) between that employee and the other NBA team. The anti-tampering rule applies to all team\nrepresentatives. For this purpose, “team representative” includes persons holding ownership interests in the\nteam as well as all full-time or part-time personnel, officers, directors, employees, agents, or other\nrepresentatives of the team, and whether classified as “employee,” “consultant,” or otherwise. The rule also\napplies to any other persons who are directed or authorized to act by team representatives. For example, it\nwould be a violation of the rule for a team to encourage or direct one of its players to recruit (whether privately\nor publicly) a player under contract to another team.\nPotential penalties for tampering include suspension of the offending person, prohibition of the offending team\nfrom hiring the person who was tampered with, forfeiture of draft picks, and individual and/or team fines of up\nto $10 million.\nThe scope of the anti-tampering rule is broad. Below are examples of conduct that is prohibited by the rule. For\npurposes of illustration, these examples all involve contact with another team’s player. However, the rule\napplies equally to contact with other personnel who are under contract with another team (such as a coach or\nGM).\nExamples of Prohibited Contact.\nDirect Contact\n208\nTeams are prohibited from having any direct communications (e.g., meetings, telephone calls, texts, etc.) with\na player on another team that violates the restrictions described above, including expressions of interest in\nobtaining the player’s current or future services. Contact with a player is permitted if authorized in advance by\nthe player’s current team. In addition, the rule does not prohibit social interaction required by courtesy, such as\na brief greeting to a player in the arena prior to a game. (Please note, however, that even social courtesies\ncould form the basis for a tampering violation if they are established to be intentional on the part of the team,\nrepeated, and/or done for the purpose of conveying interest in the player while he is under contract to another\nteam.)\nContact with Agent or Representative\nTeams are prohibited from having communications with a player’s agent or other representative that would be\nprohibited if made to the player. For example, contacting a player’s agent to express interest in trading for the\nplayer or signing the player in a subsequent season would violate the rule.\nOther Indirect Contact\nThe rule prohibits indirect communications, such as those made through intermediaries – e.g., a player’s family\nmember, friend, or personal trainer. For example, expressing interest in a player through his spouse would\nviolate the rule even if no direct contact is made with the player.\nPublic Statements. The rule also prohibits public statements that would violate the rule if made directly to a\nplayer. This includes statements by a team or its personnel that are made at live events, on team websites, via\nsocial media outlets, or to members of the media. For example, a public statement by a team’s GM that the\nteam is interested in acquiring another team’s player via trade would violate the rule. This also includes\nstatements made at events that may appear private but involve a likelihood of team comments being made\npublic, such as season ticket holder activities or sports conferences.\nFor clarity, isolated public comments by team representatives praising another team’s player will not be\nregarded as violations of the anti-tampering rule unless aggravating circumstances are present. Potential\naggravating circumstances include:\n(a) Stated interest in signing or trading for the player;\n(b) Referencing the player’s fit (or lack thereof) with his current team or\n(c) Referencing the amount of compensation a player deserves or is likely to be paid under a future\ncontract;\n(d) Repeated or excessive praise of the player;\n(e) Any other conduct, taking into account context, that is reasonably viewed as interfering with the\nplayer’s relationship with his current team (including but not limited to conduct reasonably viewed as\nconstituting an expression of interest in obtaining the player’s current or future services).\nSo, for example, “Player A is a great player” would not be a tampering violation by an executive of Team B, but\n“Player A would be a great fit for our team” would be a tampering violation.\nAs another example, brief statements made by a GM complimenting the ability of a player on another team in\nresponse to questions from the media before a game would not be a tampering violation. On the other hand, a\n209\nseries of unprompted tweets by a GM praising a prospective free agent on another team would constitute a\ntampering violation.\nPlayer-to-Player Tampering\nThe player tampering rule prohibits players from tampering with players and other team personnel. The rule is\nenforced in the following ways:\n(a) Tampering conduct or statements by a player that result from coordination with his team are prohibited. Put\ndifferently, any conduct or statements that would violate the anti-tampering rule if undertaken directly by a team\nwill also violate the rule if coordinated with or effectuated through a player.\n(b) Repeated or excessive public conduct or statements by a player that tamper with another team’s player are\nprohibited. For example, a sustained public recruiting pitch by a player on Team A that he would like to play in\nthe future with a player on Team B would violate the rule.\n(c) Conduct or statements by a player that induce another player to demand a trade will be regarded as\nviolative of the player tampering rule. For example, if a player on Team A suggests to a player on Team B that\nthe Team B player should demand a trade to Team A, the player on Team A has violated the player tampering\nrule. It is not necessary that the conduct or statements actually induce a player to demand a trade – even an\nattempt would be actionable under the player tampering rule. In addition, direct or indirect conduct or\nstatements of this kind by a player (such as by a player’s agent or family member) would violate the rule.\nThe tampering rule does not prohibit private discussions between or among players regarding future career\nplans.\nFree Agency\nWith respect to free agency, examples of prohibited conduct include (but are not limited to) public statements\nby team personnel on the impending free agency of a player under contract with another team that address:\n(1) The player’s desirability compared to other impending free agents;\n(2) The player’s potential “fit” with a new team;\n(3) Whether the player is currently being utilized well by his current team;\n(4) The amount or length of the contract offer that the player is likely to receive through free agency;\n(5) Whether a new team is “interested in,” “looking at,” “considering,” or “talking about” the player;\n(6) The fact that “any team” or “every team” would be interested in acquiring the player;\n(7) Whether a new team would be willing to go above the Salary Cap or the Tax Level in order to acquire the\nplayer; or\n(8) Whether a new team is seeking to acquire the player in a sign-and-trade transaction.\n210\nIf a team employee or representative is asked by the media about a potential free agent prior to the July 1\nfollowing the last season covered by the player’s contract, or about any other person under contract to another\nNBA team, the most prudent response is to decline comment.\nIf your team is interested in the coaching or other non-playing employment services of an impending free agent\nand would like to speak with or comment publicly about the player prior to July 1, the proper first step is to call\nthe player’s existing team and obtain permission to speak with the player for this purpose. Similarly, if your\nteam is interested in the employment services of any employee under contract to another NBA team (other\nthan a player), the proper first step is to call the team and obtain permission to speak with the employee."

The approval of the NBA and the Players Association shall rest in their absolute and\nsole discretion, and their decision shall be final, binding, and unappealable. Among the factors that may be\nconsidered by the NBA and the Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are (without\nlimitation): the circumstances surrounding the player’s dismissal and disqualification; whether the player has\nsatisfactorily completed a treatment and rehabilitation program; the player’s conduct since his dismissal,\nincluding the extent to which the player has since comported himself as a suitable role model for youth; and\nwhether the player is judged to possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.\nFor a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will consider an application for reinstatement only\nif the player has, in the opinion of the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as applicable),\nsuccessfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or aftercare prescribed by the Medical Director or the\nSPED Medical Director (as applicable). For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified in connection\nwith a Drug of Abuse, the NBA and the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only\nif the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing acceptable to the Medical Director (conducted\non at least a weekly basis), that he has not tested positive (i) for a Drug of Abuse or synthetic cannabinoid\nwithin the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and during any period\nwhile his application is being reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or her\n212\nprofessional judgment, for marijuana and/or alcohol for the six (6) months prior to the submission of his\napplication for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed. For a Veteran\nPlayer who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 12(a) above in connection with a SPED, the NBA\nand the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate,\nby proof of random urine and/or blood testing acceptable to the SPED Medical Director (conducted on at least\na weekly basis), that he has not tested positive for a SPED within the twelve (12) months prior to the\nsubmission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while his application is being reviewed.\nThe granting of an application for reinstatement may be conditioned upon random testing of the player or such\nother terms as may be agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association.\nAny player who has been reinstated and is subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with\nthe NBA or any of its Teams shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement.\nIn the event that the application for reinstatement of a First-Year Player dismissed and disqualified pursuant to\nSection 6(b) above is approved, such player, by reason of his Player Contract having been rendered null and\nvoid, shall be deemed not to have completed his Player Contract by rendering the playing services called for\nthereunder. Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a\nPlayer Contract with any NBA Team, except with his prior team.\nA First-Year Player who has been reinstated, immediately upon such reinstatement, notify the Team to which\nhe was under contract at the time of his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”). Upon receipt of\nsuch notification, the previous Team shall then have thirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player\nwith a stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the event that the Tender is made during a\nSeason, of at least the remainder of that Season) and calling for at least the Minimum Player Salary then\napplicable to that player but not more than the Salary provided for in Section 13(f)(iii) below. If the previous\nTeam makes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the only NBA\nTeam with which the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player\nContract with the previous Team within the year following such Tender, the player shall thereupon be deemed a\nRestricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal.

For clarity, use of\nracist, sexist, homophobic, or other discriminatory or derogatory language will remain prohibited at all times\nand will subject a player to appropriate discipline.\nCriticism of Game Officials\nRule I.O.3 of the annual Player Conduct, NBA Uniform Requirements, Dress Code, and Other Player-Related\nMatters memorandum will be revised to provide that a player who publicly criticizes game officials will be\nconsidered to be acting in a manner prejudicial or detrimental to the NBA and subject to appropriate discipline\nonly when the criticism is unprofessional or inappropriate.\nPlayer and Game Official Conduct\nOn a quarterly basis, the NBA and Players Association will meet to discuss the relationship and interactions\nbetween players and NBA referees, including any discipline imposed by the NBA on referees for conduct on\nthe playing court.\nFines Imposed on Teams\n216\nFor any fine imposed on a team, team Governor, or other team personnel by the NBA for violations of league\nrules regarding (A) injury, illness, rest, and game status reporting, (B) timing of free agency discussions, (C)\ntampering, (D) leaving the bench area during a game, or (E) team criticism of game officials, 50% of such fine\namount will be payable to the NBA and 50% will be payable to an NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization (as\ndefined in Article VI, Section 6(a) of the CBA); provided, however, that the maximum amount payable to an\nNBPA-Selected Charitable Organization will be 50% of the amount of the maximum fine that could be imposed\non a player for engaging in the conduct at issue and provided further that where there is no specified maximum\nfine for a player, the maximum amount payable to the NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization will be $50,000\n(i.e., 50% of $100,000).\nHow the rule works: If the Mavericks were fined $750K under the new CBA, $375K would have gone to the\nPlayers Association.\nPractices\nWhen a player, without proper and reasonable excuse, fails to attend a practice session scheduled by his\nTeam, he shall be subject to the following discipline: (i) for the first missed practice during a Season – $2,500;\n(ii) for the second missed practice during such Season – $5,000; (iii) for the third missed practice during such\nSeason – $7,500; and (iv) for the fourth (or any additional) missed practice during such Season – such\ndiscipline as is reasonable under the circumstances.\nWhen a player, without proper and reasonable excuse, refuses or intentionally fails to attend any practice\nsession scheduled by his Team, he shall be subject to such discipline as is reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\nOther Fines\n●   Mandatory Programs: $20K\n●   Promotional Appearances: $20K\n●   Media Training: $20K\n●   Business of Basketball: $5K\n●   Anti-Gambling Sessions: $100K\nUnlawful Violence\nWhen a player is convicted of (including by a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere to) a violent felony,\nhe shall immediately be suspended by the NBA for a minimum of ten (10) games.\nFirearms and Other Weapons.\nWhenever a player is physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by a Team, the\nNBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a player is traveling on any NBA-related business, whether\non behalf of the player’s Team, the NBA, or any League-related entity, such player shall not possess a firearm\nof any kind or any other deadly weapon.

Each player is also required to provide the Team with proof of any modifications or additions made to\nthis information during the Season.\n(c) Any violation shall be considered conduct prejudicial to the NBA under Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution\nand By-Laws,and shall therefore subject the player to discipline by the NBA in accordance with such Article.\nOne Penalty\nThe NBA and a Team shall not discipline players for the same act or conduct. The NBA’s disciplinary action will\npreclude or supersede disciplinary action by any Team for the same act or conduct.\nWhen the NBA becomes aware of any potential or actual disciplinary action which may be or has been\nimposed by a Team for a player’s act or conduct, the NBA may, within forty-eight (48) hours, prohibit the\ndiscipline from being imposed or rescind the discipline that has been imposed, as applicable. If the NBA\nprohibits or rescinds the discipline, only the NBA shall thereafter be permitted to impose discipline on the\nplayer for that act or conduct. If the NBA does not prohibit or rescind the Team’s discipline, the Team may\nimpose its proposed discipline or the Team’s discipline will remain in effect, as applicable, and, if the Team’s\ndiscipline becomes effective or remains in effect, the NBA may not thereafter impose discipline on the player\nfor that act or conduct.\nThe same act or conduct by a player may result in both a termination of the player’s Uniform Player Contract\nby his Team and the suspension of the player by the NBA if the egregious nature of the act or conduct is so\nlacking in justification as to warrant such double penalty, and (ii) both the NBA and the Team to which a player\nis traded may impose discipline for a player’s failure to report for a trade.\nLeague Investigations.\nPlayers are required to cooperate with investigations of alleged player misconduct conducted by the NBA.\nFailure to so cooperate, in the absence of a reasonable apprehension of criminal prosecution, will subject the\nplayer to reasonable fines and/or suspensions imposed by the NBA. Any investigations of alleged misconduct\nthat is covered by the Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse shall be\ngoverned by the terms of that Policy.\nThe NBA shall provide the Players Association with such advance notice as is reasonable in the circumstances\nof any interview or meeting to be held (in person or by telephone) between an NBA representative and a player\nunder investigation\nPlayer Arrests\nA Team shall not impose discipline on a player solely on the basis of the fact that the player has been arrested.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Team may impose discipline on a player for the conduct underlying the\n218\nplayer’s arrest if it has an independent basis for doing so, (b) nothing herein shall permit a Team to discipline a\nplayer for his failure to cooperate with a Team’s investigation of his alleged misconduct if he has a reasonable\napprehension of criminal prosecution, and (c) nothing herein shall prevent a Team from precluding a player\nfrom participating in Team activities without loss of pay to the extent it otherwise has the right to do so."
