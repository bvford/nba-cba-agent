    "content": "**G League Rights** **Generally**\n\nThe G League’ operates on universal 1-year Contracts for all Players. In determining which Team has priority to sign the Player in the offseason, there is an order of priority for assiging the Players, based on the type of “Rights” the Team may have to a Player.\n\nTwo of those are **Returning Rights** and **Affiliate Rights.**\n\n1. Returning Rights – Players who played the prior G League season with the G League Team; and\n2. Affiliate Rights -Players who participated in Training Camp with the G League Team’s affiliated NBA Team.\n\nReturning Rights have preference over Affiliate Rights.\n\n**G League Rights and the Exhibit 10 Bonus**\n\nThe Exhibit 10 Bonus is awarded to an **Affiliate Player** when he is waived by the NBA Team, and then is assigned to the G League affiliate Team.\n\nWhat happens if another Team has Returning Rights to the Affiliate Player and therefore signs him using its priority over the Team with the Affiliate Rights?\n\nThe Player will be ineligible for the Exhibit 10 Bonus because he does not play for the affiliate G League Team.\n\n**Notice of Returning Rights**\n\nThe NBA Team, when signing him to his Exhibit 10 Contract, is required to provide notice that a different NBA G League Affiliate holds his Returning Rights . This allows the Player to understand the risk that he may not play for the affiliate G League Team if his Exhibit 10 Contract is waived.\n\n**🏀** **A G League Hypothetical**  \nIn the 2025 offseason, the Houston Rockets sign Player A to an Exhibit 10 Contract with an $85,300 Exhibit 10 Bonus.  \n  \nPrior to the Regular Season, the Rockets waive Player A, with the intention to have him play with their G League Affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, using their Affiliate Rights to sign him. This would earn Player A his $85,300 bonus should he play for 60 consecutive days.  \n  \nHowever, Player A played the 2024-25 G League Season with the Austin Spurs, who have his Returning Rights and a higher priority to sign him over the Vipers. The Spurs sign him in the G League, and Player A loses out on his $85,300 (but should have had notice in his Exhibit 10 Contract with the Rockets that the Spurs had his Returning Rights)."

A Contract, [Extension](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/extensions/) or [Renegotiation](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/renegotiations/) that is for 4+ Seasons at the time of Signing; and\n2. The Player is 38 as of October 1st for at least one of those Seasons.\n\n**Age Caveat**\n\nYou’ll notice that all ages are based on the Player’s age as of October 1st of each Season, irrespective of when the Player is signed. There is one caveat:\n\nIf (i) a Player’s birthday is during the [Moratorium Period](https://cbaguide.com/calendar/), and (ii) signs the Over 38 Contract within 5 days after the Moratorium ends, then his age _at the time of signing_ is deemed his age as of the prior June 30th (i.e. prior to his birthday).\n\n**Contract Length Breakdown**\n\nThe length of the Contract is a key factor in determining if it’s an Over 38 Contract, but it is based upon the Player’s age and [Bird Rights](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/#bird) status.\n\nAny Contract \n\nNon-Full Bird Free Agents Only \n\n| Age at Time of Signing (Season 1) | Season 2 | Season 3 | Season 4 | Season 5 | Season 6\\* |\n| --------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |\n| 34                                | 35       | 36       | 37       | 38       | 39         |\n| 35                                | 36       | 37       | 38       | 39       | 40         |\n| 36                                | 38       | 38       | 39       | 40       | 41         |\n| 37                                | 38       | 39       | 40       | 41       | 42         |\n\n \\* Note that no Free Agents can sign 6-Year Contracts (Extensions only).\n\n### Are there “Over 38 Years”?\n\nDetermining what Salaries to take and reallocate depends on whether the Player signed as a [Full Bird Free Agent](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/#bird) with his prior team or not.\n\n**If not a Full Bird Free Agent**\n\nIf the Player is _not_ a Full Bird Free Agent, then you take all the Salaries starting from the _later_ of (i) the 4th Salary Cap Year of the Over 38 Contract or (ii) the first Year the Player is 38 as of October 1st.\n\nThese are the **Over 38 Years** and any years prior the **Non-Over 38 Years**.\n\n**Full Bird Free Agents**\n\nIf a (i) [Full Bird Free Agent](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/#bird) signs with his Prior Team (ii) will be 35 or 36 at the time of signing and (iii) is not signed via [Sign-and-Trade,](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/trades/signandtrade/) then the following rules apply (note that if the age requirement is not reached, then apply the rule for Non Full Bird Free Agents above).\n\n1. 4-Year Contract – If it is a 4-year contract, then do _not_ reallocate any Salaries.\n2. 5-Year Contract – If it is a 5-year contract, then only reallocate the Salary from the 5th Year."

This Salary is then Reallocated based on the Percentage of the Non-Over 38 Years. As you can see, this Player would have a significant Cap Hit based upon this rule, making the signing a non-starter.\n\n### “Reattribution” through the Life of the Contract\n\n**When Does Reattribution Occur? – The Timing**\n\nThe Reallocation above is not a fixed amount for the life of the Contract.\n\nThe remaining Salary will continue to be **Reattributed** if the Contract remains active throughout the life of the Contract. \n\nHowever, Reattribution does not automatically occur each Season. Instead, you apply the following rule: Reattribution occurs on a July 1st if (i) the Over 38 Contract remains active and (ii) an Over 38 Year is within 2 years of such July 1st.\n\n**How Does Reattribution Occur? – The Math**\n\nIf on July 1st, Reattribution is to occur, then the remaining Salary is aggregated _in equal shares_ to each of the _three_ or fewer Salary Cap Years. \n\n**✍️** Notice that now the Salaries are not aggregated in proportion anymore, but are spread equally over the current Salary Cap Year as well as the following 2 Seasons (or 1 Season if there aren’t 2 Seasons remaining).\n\n| Yearly Reattribution Cap Hit |              |                 |              |              |             |             |             |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Age                          | Year         | Original Salary | Year 1       | Year 2       | Year 3      | Year 4      | Year 5      |\n| 36                           | Year 1       | $45,000,000     | $80,555,556  | –            | –           | –           | –           |\n| 37                           | Year 2       | $48,600,000     | $87,000,000  | $60,148,148  | –           | –           | –           |\n| 38                           | Year 3       | $52,200,000     | $93,444,444  | $60,148,148  | $40,098,765 | –           | –           |\n| 39                           | Year 4       | $55,800,000     | –            | $60,148,148  | $40,098,765 | $40,098,765 | –           |\n| 40                           | Year 5       | $59,400,000     | –            | –            | $40,098,765 | $40,098,765 | $40,098,765 |\n| Total                        | $261,000,000 | $261,000,000    | $180,444,444 | $120,296,296 | $80,197,531 | $40,098,765 |             |\n\n**🏀** Using the same Contract from the Reallocation above, this graphic shows a year-by-year Reattribution of the Cap Hit. What you’ll notice is that when you add the total Cap Hit hit for the year with the Cap Hit of the prior years, you will always equal the same amount of Salary from the original contract. In other words, for “Cap Hit – Year 4” the total Cap Hit is $80,197,531\\. If you add the Cap Hits for the years that have occured in the prior years: $40,098,765, $60,148,148 and $80,555,556 you will get the same total of the Original Salary: $261,000,000 (subject to some rounding measures). This shows that the purpose of the rule is to always have the Team take the same Cap Hit over the life of the Contract, but absorb the majority of the Cap Hit in the front-end of the Contract under the assumption the Player will retire."

Otherwise, it is deemed Unlikely.\n\n### Appealing the General Test\n\nIf the League or NBPA do not believe this accurately reflects the the nature of the Performance Bonus, they can request a “Basketball Expert” review the likeliness of the Bonus _at the time of signing the Contract/Extension/Renegotiation_.\n\nThe applicable standard for the Basketball Expert depends on the party appealing, who will carry the burden of proof :\n\n1. The League: If it is _more likely than not_ that the bonus will be earned, then it is considered a Likely Bonus.\n2. The NBPA: If it is _very likely_ that the bonus will _not_ be earned, then it is considered a Unlikely Bonus.\n\nThe Expert’s ruling is final and unappealable as to how the Performance Bonus is treated.\n\n### What if No Preceding Season?\n\nIf there is no applicable preceding season (either the Player did not play or it is an Expansion Team), then the NBPA and League will agree on the likeliness.\n\nIf they cannot agree on the likeliness, then the Expert will conduct a hearing, but apply a different standard than a standard appeal: In this situation, the Expert simply determines whether the Bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned.\n\n### Team Salary Pending a Likeliness Determination\n\nWhile the appeal process takes place, the entire Performance Bonus is included in the Team’s Team Salary.\n\n### Performance Bonuses and Trades \n\nWhen a Player is traded to a new Team and has team-related Performance Bonuses, those bonuses will be reassessed for likeliness based upon the Receiving Team.\n\n**🏀** **Dinwiddie’s Bonuses Switched to Unlikely in Trade**  \nDuring the 2022-23 season, Spencer Dinwiddie was traded from Dallas to Brooklyn. He had Performance Bonuses linked to achieving Round Two and the Conference Finals. Because Dallas had reached that achievement in 2021-2022, they were deemed Likely. Since Brooklyn was eliminated from the First Round of the Playoffs in 2021-2022, the Bonuses switched from Likely to Unlikely and no longer counted toward Team Salary. \n\n### Performance Bonuses Achieved Prior to Extension\n\nWhen a Player adds a Performance Bonus as part of an [Extension](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/extensions/), but achieves the Performance Bonus during the original term of the Contract that did not include the Bonus, it is not awarded. The achievement will, however, change to Likely if it was originally Unlikely, and count toward [Team Salary](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/teamsalary/).\n\n**🏀** **McDaniels’ Bonus Not Earned, but Changed to “Likely”**  \nJaden McDaniels added a Performance Bonus of earning All-Defensive Team when he signed his Rookie Scale Extension in October 2023\\. McDaniels achieved All-Defense during the 2023-2024 Season (i.e. before the Extension kicked in in 2024-2025). Therefore, he was not awarded the Bonus.

[Extension](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/extensions/) – If the amount of Unlikely Bonuses in the Salary Cap Year in which the Extension is signed exceeds the 15% of the Player’s Regular Salary for that year, the Extension may provide for up to the same percentage of Unlikely Bonuses in the first year of the extended term.\n3. [Renegotiation](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/renegotiations/) – Cannot increase Unlikely Bonuses in a Renegotiation if after such Renegotiation the amount of Unlikely Bonuses covered by the renegotiated contract exceeds 15% of the Player’s Regular Salary.\n\n### Room Requirement for Unlikely Bonuses\n\nAlthough Unlikely Bonuses are not counted as [Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/)–and therefore don’t count toward the Salary Cap–a Contract cannot include Unlikely Bonuses if his Unlikely Bonuses plus his Salary would cause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed its Room.\n\nWhen calculating [Team Salary](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/teamsalary/) to determine if there is [Room](https://cbaguide.com/definitions/#room) for a new Unlikely Bonus, you add in all Unlikely Bonuses included for all Players on the roster that might be paid that season.\n\n**🏀** **Rule Closes a Loophole Used to Sign Irving and Durant to Brooklyn**  \nThis rule was put into place to close a loophole. Let’s say the Nets sign Durant and Kyrie in 2019 after winning 35 games. They could include the benchmark to win 36 games as a Performance Bonus in their contracts, and it would be considered “Unlikely” (absent an appeal) and therefore not count toward the Salary Cap, giving the Nets more Cap Space to sign players.

The Team therefore uses the NTMLE to sign him to a $14 million starting Salary. Since the Team used the NTMLE, the increase/decrease limitations are 5%, rather than the 8% permitted if Early Bird Rights were used.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe maximum increase/decrease is a fixed amount determined by calculating the percentage of Year 1\\. It is _not_ compounded over future years.\n\n**🏀** **Bridges Receives 8% Raises in Extension**  \nIn 2025, Mikal Bridges received a 4-Year, $150 million Extension with the Knicks. His Year 1 Salary was $33,482,145 and he received his maximum raise of 8% ($2,678,571) each Season to reach the $150 million total.\n\nIf an [Extension](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/extensions/) is signed stating that Year 1 Salary is based upon a percentage of the Salary Cap, then the annual increase/decrease can also state the percentage rather than a specific dollar amount. The Contract will then be amended to the fixed amount on July 1st of the extended term when the amount is known.\n\n**🏀** **Mobley’s 8% Gets Fixed on July 1st**In 2024, Evan Mobley signed a maximum Rookie Scale Extension with the Cavaliers for 25% of the Salary Cap in Year 1, that increased to 30% if he earned DPOY, which he indeed achieved. The Extension provided for 8% raises each season based upon his Year 1 Salary. On July 1st 2025, his Year 1 Salary was then known to be $46,394,100 and his raise was therefore $3,711,528 each year."

    "title": "Limit Each Compensation Type",
    "content": "The increase/decrease limitations are broken into the following [Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/) types:\n\n1. [Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/), exclusing [Incentive Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/incentivecompensation/);\n2. [Regular Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/regularsalary/);\n3. [Incentive Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/incentivecompensation/) – Each individual bonus may only be increased/decreased by the applicable limit;  \n   * The criteria for earnning any Bonus must also be unchanged from year to year.\n\n**🏀** **Explaining How the Rule Works**  \nThe rule means that you look at increase and decrease limitations within each Compensation type rather than as a whole. Therefore, if a Player receives $10 million in Regular Salary in Year 1 with $2 million in Performance Bonuses with 5% maximum raises, then you apply the 5% to $10 million Regular Salary and 5% to the $2 million Bonuses separately, rather than a combined $12 million.\n\n**💡** **Why Split Compensation Types for This Limitation?**  \nWithout splitting Compensation types for the increase/decrease limitations a Team can manipulate Team Salary year to year. For example, a Team can offer $20 million in Base Compensation with $2 million in Unlikely Bonuses (which don’t count toward the Salary Cap) in Year 1, then in Year 2 increase Regular Salary to $23,100,000 (5% of all Compensation) while dropping Unlikely Bonuses to $0."

It is meant to give an RFA’s Prior Team a better chance at resigning the Player when the Prior Team doesn’t yet have Full Bird Rights to sign the Player over the Salary Cap for as much as he might be worth.\n\nThe Arenas Provision will _only_ apply when the RFA has 1 or 2 YOS.\n\nWhen this is the case, Year 1 of an Offer Sheet is limited to the NTMLE (with adjustments in Year 3 and 4).\n\nBelow are the details of the limitation and how it affects Team Salary when applied.\n\n### Salary Limitations/Adjustments\n\nBelow is a year-by-year breakdown of the Arenas provision:\n\n**Year 1 Limitation**\n\nThe Salary (plus [Unlikely Bonuses](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/incentivecompensation/#performance)) in the First Year of the Offer Sheet cannot exceed the amount of the [NTMLE](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/#ntmle) for the applicable Year.\n\n**Year 2 Limitation**\n\nThe Second Year is limited to a 5% raise from Year 1.\n\n**Year 3 Maximum Adjustment**\n\nIf Years 1 and 2 of the Offer Sheet are the maximum provided above, then Year 3 can be _up to_ the [Maximum Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/contractlimitations/) the Player _would have earned_ in Year 3 had he been offered his Maximum Salary since Year 1.\n\nThe Offering Team must have [Room](https://cbaguide.com/definitions/#room) in _Year 1 equal to the average aggregate Salaries of all four Years_.\n\n**Year 4 Limitation**\n\nIf Year 3 is for the Maximum Salary permitted above, then Year 4 is limited to a 4.5% increase from Year 3.\n\n### Calculating a Maximum Arenas Offer\n\nBelow are the steps to calculate a **Maximum Arenas Offer** and how much Cap Space a Team needs to make the offer.\n\nCalculating Maximum Arenas Offer.\n\n**Step 1 – Take the Player’s Maximum Salary.** \n\nFor all Players subject to the Arenas provision, their Maximum Salary is 25% of the Salary Cap. For 2025–26, this is **$38,661,750**.\n\n**Step 2 – Find the Maximum Salary for Year 3.** \n\nHow much _could_ the Player earn in Year 3 if earning a Maximum Salary starting in Year 1 (with 5% maximum raises).\n\nFor 2025–26, this amount is **$42,527,925**.\n\n**Step 3 – Break down all yearly amounts of the Maximum Arenas Offer now that we have Year 3.** \n\nYear 1 – $14,104,000 (NTMLE Amount for 2025–26)\n\nYear 2 – $14,809,200 (5% raise from Year 1)\n\nYear 3 – $42,527,925 (Maximum Salary for Year 3)\n\nYear 4 – $44,441,682 (4.5% raise from Year 3)\n\nThe Maximum Arenas Offer is a **4-Year, $115,882,8076 Contract**.\n\n**Step 4 – Calculate how much Room the Offering Team needs for the Maximum Arenas Offer.** \n\nThe Room needed by the Offering Team for Year 1 is the average of all four years:\n\n**$28,970,702**\n\n### Calculating Maximum Arenas Offer Based on Cap Space\n\nWe know a Team can make the Maximum Arenas Offer above if they have $29 million in Cap Space. But a Team can offer _up to_ this amount.\n\nSo what happens if a Team has less than the $29 million in Room? How do we calculate the Maximum Arenas Offer the specific _Team_ can make?\n\nFirst, Years 1 ($14,104,000) and 2 ($14,809,200) are the fixed maximum amounts that must be made. We also know that Year 4 will be based on a 4.5% raise of Year 3\\. The key is taking the Team’s Cap Space and working backwards to find Year 3.\n\nCalulating Arenas Offer with Team's Cap Space\n\n_**Assume Year 1 Cap Space of $26,000,000**_ \n\n**Step 1 – Turn Cap Space into a 4-year total.** \n\n$26,000,000 × 4 = $104,000,000\n\n**Step 2 – Subtract fixed years from the total.** \n\n$104,000,000 − $14,104,000 − $14,809,200 = $75,086,800\n\n(So Years 3 & 4 must total $75,086,800)\n\n**Step 3 – Divide by 2.045 to get Year 3** \n\n$75,086,800 ÷ 2.045 = $36,717,262\n\n**Step 4 – Multiply Year 3 by 1.045 to get Year 4** \n\n$36,717,262 × 1.045 = $38,369,539\n\n**Step 5 – Layout all years and confirm average equals Year 1 Cap Space** \n\nYear 1 – $14,104,000\n\nYear 2 – $14,809,200\n\nYear 3 – $36,717,262\n\nYear 4 – $38,369,539\n\n**Total = $104,000,001**\n\n$104,000,001 ÷ 4 = $26,000,000\n\n### Effect on Team Salary\n\n**Offer Sheet Not Matched**\n\nIf the Prior Team does not match the Offer Sheet, then the Offering Team will apply the average of the aggregate of each Season’s [Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/) across all Years.\n\n**Offer Sheet Matched**\n\nIf the Prior Team excercises its ROFR and matches, it depends on the Prior Team’s [Team Salary](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/teamsalary/) at the time.\n\nIf the Prior Team’s Team Salary and the average of the aggregate Salaries is _above_ the Salary Cap, then the Player’s [Salary ](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/)remains the same as in the Offer Sheet.\n\nIf the Prior Team’s Team Salary and the average of the aggregate Salaries is _below_ the [Salary Cap](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/), then the Team may elect to apply the average of the aggregate Salaries across all Years or keep it the same as the Offer Sheet.\n\nThe election must be contained within the ROFR exercise notice."

This is called the Player’s applicable **Rookie Scale Amount**.\n\nYou can find the [Rookie Scale Salaries here](https://cbaguide.com/resources/rookiescale/).\n\nSigning a Rookie Scale Contract is a [Salary Cap Exception](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/), allowing Teams to sign their First Round Picks over the Salary Cap.\n\nThe Player is to earn a minimum of 80% [Base Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/basecompensation/) of the Rookie Scale Amount, and can negotiate [Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/) and [Unlikely Bonuses](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/incentivecompensation/#performance) up to 120%.\n\nIt is common practice for Teams to pay the Player the 120% unless there is a specific reason for doing otherwise.\n\n**🏀** **Pacome Dadiet Signs for Less than 120% with Knicks**  \nIn 2024, the Knicks signed Dadiet to his Rookie Scale Contract for only 80% Base Compensation in his first season.

If the 140% increase is still below market value, then the Team must allow the Player to reach Free Agency to sign the Player to a larger Contract, availing him to other bidders. Take, for example, Austin Reaves of the Lakers. In 2025-26, Reaves is earning $13.9 million in the final year of his Contract. The first year of his Extension is limited to $19.46 million, which is still below his market value. The Lakers will therefore have to allow him to reach Free Agency before trying to sign him to a larger Contract using Full Bird Rights.\n\n**Incentive Compensation**\n\nIf the last Season of the original Contract included [Incentive Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/incentivecompensation/), then the first Season of the Extension can include 140% of the [Likely and Unlikely Bonuses](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/incentivecompensation/#performance), respectively, in the last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term (see below regarding Non-Performance Bonuses).\n\n**🏀** **Gordon Signs Max Extension with Nuggets**  \nIn October 2024, Aaron Gordon signed an Extension with the Nuggets that starts in 2026-27\\. His Extension included maximum increases for both his Base Salary and his Incentive Compensatation, broken down below:  \n  \n| Season  | Base Salary | IncentiveCompensation | IncreaseAmount |\n| ------- | ----------- | --------------------- | -------------- |\n| 2025-26 | $22,841,455 | $1,200,000            |                |\n| 2026-27 | $31,978,037 | $1,680,000            | 140%           |\n| 2027-28 | $34,536,280 | $1,814,400            | 8%             |\n| 2028-29 | $37,094,523 | $1,948,800            | 8%             |\n\n**Adjustment for Certain Bonuses**\n\nWhen determining the Player’s maximum allowable [Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/) in a Veteran Extension, you add (i) bonuses for physical/academic achievement, and (ii) bonuses related to promotional appearances to _Regular Salary_, and exclude them from _Incentive Compensation_.\n\n**Maximum Salary Limitation**\n\nIf 140% increase exceeds the Player’s [Maximum Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/contractlimitations/), he will be reduced to his applicable Maximum Salary.\n\n**🏀** **Luka Limited to Max Salary in Extension**  \nIn 2025, Luka Doncic signed a new Extension for his Maximum Salary of 30% of the Salary Cap. This is because a 140% salary in the final season of his existing contract would have exceeded the 30% maximum he is allowed.\n\n### Designated Veteran Extension (the “Supermax”)\n\nIf a Player is eligible for the **Supermax**, then he can avoid the 140% limitation and sign for 30% to 35% of the Salary Cap.\n\n**Supermax Eligibility**\n\nA Player is eligible for the Supermax if the following elements are met:\n\n1. Completed 7 or 8 YOS at time of signing Extension;\n2. Has 1 or 2 Seasons remaining on Contract (including Option Year);\n3. Remains on his first Team _or_ was traded during his first 4 Seasons;\n4. Has achieved the [Higher Max Criteria](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/contractlimitations/#criteria) at the time of signing his Extension.\n\n**🏀** **Losing Supermax Eligibility due to Trade**During the 2024-25 Season, Luka Doncic was traded from the Mavericks to the Lakers. This was his 7th year in the League. Because he did not remain on his original team, nor was he traded in his first four seasons he lost Supermax eligibility even though he reached the Higher Max Criteria.\n\n**🏀** **Hitting Eligiblity in Time for Supermax**In the summer of 2023, Jaylen Brown was entering the final season of his Rookie Scale Extension and was extension eligible. Luckily for Brown he achieved Second-Team All-NBA in the 2022-2023 Season. As a result, he hit the Higher Max Criteria and was eligible for the Supermax with the Celtics.\n\n**No Conditional Language for Supermax**\n\nUnlike [Rookie Scale Extensions](#conditional), Veteran Extensions don’t allow conditional language for a Player to reach the Higher Maximum Criteria after the Extension is signed like the Rookie Scale Extension does. \n\nThe Player, like Jaylen Brown above, must have reached the Higher Maximum Criteria prior to the signing of the Extension\n\n**Trade Restriction of Supermax Contract**\n\nPlayer  cannot be traded for 1 Year after signing Supermax.\n\n### The Ten-Year Veteran Exception\n\nIf (i) a Player played for his current Team for 10+ Seasons and (ii) whose [Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/) declined in the final Season of his Contract, then his maximum allowable Salary can be the following:\n\nThe _greater of_ (i) 107.5% of the average of the [Regular Salaries](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/regularsalary/) for each Salary Cap Year covered by the original Contract beginning when it was entered into or extended, or (ii) 107.5% of the Regular Salary in the last Salary Cap Year covered by his original Contract.\n\nIf this amount is less than the 140% rule above, then the 140% rule can be applied instead."

A Renegotiation allows a Team to bump the last year of his Salary to increase the total amount offered in an Extension.  \n  \nThis is the more common scenario used to extend Players without the risk of them going to Free Agency (e.g. Jaren Jackson, Jr. in 2025).  \n  \nScenario #2 – Pay More Up-Front to Clear Team Salary in the Future  \nIf a Team has Cap Space now, but knows other Extensions will significantly increase their Team Salary in the future, they can increase a Player’s Salary up-front and drop his Salary in future Seasons to lessen Team Salary for other signings.

[ETO’s](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/options/) – Counted as guaranteed salary;\n2. [Team Options ](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/options/)– Not owed to the Player if cut prior to exercising Team Option;\n3.

This is the Player’s **Earned Compensation**.\n\n**Step 3** – If his Earned Compensation is greater than his Protected Compensation for the Current Season, then the Earned Compensation is the Team’s Dead Salary. If it is less, then the Team’s Dead Salary is the amount of his Protected Compensation.\n\n**Base Compensation and the Minimum Salary Subsidy**\n\nNote that Base Compensation does not factor in the [subsidization](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/salary/#oneyear) for a 1-Year Minimum Salary Player. Use the Minimum Salary applicable for the Player’s [YOS](https://cbaguide.com/definitions/#yos).

However, if he is waived you use the full amount of his [Minimum Salary](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/contractlimitations/).\n\n**🏀** **Waiving a Minimum Salary with Compensation Protection**During the 2024-25 Season, the Timberwolves waived P.J. Dozier on December 28th, clearing waivers on December 30th. Dozier’s Base Compensation was $2,613,120 and his Contract was guaranteed for $1 million. 70 days had elapsed as of December 30th. **Step 1** – $2,613,120 ÷ 174 (Regular Season Days) = $15,017 Per-Day Salary. **Step 2** – $15,017 x 70 (days elapsed) = $1,051,255 Earned Compensation. **Step 3** – Because his Earned Compensation was greater than the $1 million guaranteed Salary, Minnesota owed Dozier $1,051,255 in Dead Salary.\n\n###"

    "title": "Stretching Salary",
    "content": "### Payment vs. Effect on Team Salary\n\n**Stretching** Salary means spreading the Dead Salary across twice the remaining Seasons, plus one more Season.\n\nThe actual [Payment Arrangement](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/paymentarrangements/#deadsalary) of the Dead Salary is automatically stretched.\n\nFor [Team Salary](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/teamsalary/) purposes, the Team can elect whether to stretch the Dead Salary, or to keep the Dead Salary as it was originally allocated in the Contract.\n\n**🏀** **To Stretch or Not to Stretch**Player is waived on August 1st for the 2025-26 season with $5 million for both 2025-26 and 2026-27\\. Automatically, the Player will be _paid_ $2 million over the next five Seasons. The Team can then elect to (i) have $5 million in Dead Salary in 2025-26 and 2026-27, or (ii) lower the Dead Salary amount for those Seasons and spread it across the five Seasons in line with the stretch provision (the Team can also wait and stretch only the Second Season in a **Delayed Stretch** discussed below). \n\n### Calculating Stretched Dead Salary\n\n**Election from July 1st to August 31st**\n\nDead Salary stretched equally for twice the amount of Remaining Seasons, plus one (including the Current Season).\n\n**Election from September 1 through June 30th**\n\nAny Dead Salary for the Current Season shall remain unchanged. Any Dead Salary for Future Seasons will be stretched equally for twice the amount of Remaining Seasons, plus one (not including the Current Season).\n\n**🏀** **Bucks Waive-and-Stretch Lillard’s $112 million**In the 2025 offseason, the Bucks waived Lillard’s remaining $112,583,216 in guaranteed salary. Lillard had two Seasons remaining, which included his Player Option. The Bucks stretched his Dead Salary over the 5 Seasons for $22,516,603 each Season through 2029-30\\. This helped clear cap space to sign Myles Turner in the same offseason.\n\n### Delayed Stretch\n\nThe Team can elect to stretch the Dead Salary at any point through the term of the waived Contract until September 1st of the last Season.\n\n**🏀** **Delaying the Stretch Election**Taking the “To Stretch or Not to Stretch” Example above. The team can wait until the 2026 offseason, and elect a Delayed Stretch for only the 2026-27 Seson (election to be made prior to September 1st). This means that the $5 million in Dead Salary was on the books for the 2025-26 Seasons, and now the Team will stretch the remaining $5 million across three seasons at $1.66 million through 2028-29.\n\n**🏀** **Delayed Stretch Before Rubio’s Final Season of Dead Salary**Rubio’s Buyout with the Cavaliers is discussed in detail below. After the Buyout, the Cavaliers elected to Stretch his 2024-25 Dead Salary of $1,274,015, which is stretched equally at $424,672 over 3 Seasons (twice the remaining seasons (1), plus one).\n\n### Limitation on Stretch Election\n\nA Team’s Stretched Salary can only make up 15% of the Salary Cap for a particular Season.\n\n**🏀** **Suns stretch 15% of the Salary Cap in 2025-26**In the 2025 offseason, the Suns waived Bradley Beal’s Contract with $103,870,200 remaining in guaranteed Salary. The Suns already had stretched Salary from waivers in 2024 of Nassir Little ($3,107,143) and E.J. Liddell ($706,898). Beal had to agree to a buyout, reducing his guaranteed Salary to $96,917,050 to allow the Suns to stretch his Salary, which takes up 12.5% of the Salary Cap and keeping them right at 15% of the maximum Stretched Salary for the 2025-26 Season."

Player has several performance bonuses in his contract reaching a total of $1 million. Team B is responsible for the payment of these Bonuses. Team A agrees to pay 25% of the Bonuses. Therefore, $250,000 is reduced from Team A’s allowable conveyance of Cash-in-Trade at the time of the Trade, and $250,000 is reduced from Team B’s allowable receipt of Cash-in-Trade at the time of the Trade, irrespective if the Player achieves the performance benchmarks."

Prior to the Trade Call, the parties exchange necessary health information.\n3. All terms and conditions of the Trade are disclosed and agreed to during a conference call with the League.\n4. Follow up email confirming the terms will be sent by the Teams to the League.\n5. League will send an email confirming all conditions required for Trade to be consummated."

However, he failed his physical exam, and as a result the Lakers rescinded the Trade.  \n\nSometimes, rather than cancelling the Trade, Teams will adjust the terms based on the results of a physical examination.\n\n**🏀** **Blazers remove 2nd Round Picks for Holiday Trade**  \nIn 2025, the Blazers initially had an agreement to send Anfernee Simons and two 2nd Round Picks to the Celtics for Jrue Holiday. After poor results from Holiday’s physical exam, the Blazers and Celtics agreed that the 2nd Round Picks would be dropped from the agreement.  \n  \nNote that the Williams Trade above had no chance of altering the Trade because it was made right at the deadline. Once the physical exam results came back, they were past the Trade Deadline and therefore couldn’t alter the terms and execute a new Trade."

But in the CBA, a Traded Player Exception can refer to all of the different types of TPE’s."

The Team has 12 months ([or less if over the First Apron](#caveat)) to complete the Trade.\n\n**✍️** The technical sense of the Non-Simultaenous Trade is this: The Trade is not completed until all of the money in the TPE runs out, or the time runs out to use the TPE. So for the Team, it is all considered one, ongoing non-simultaneous trade.\n\nWhat this means: The Team trades Player A for X amount of dollars more than the Incoming Trade Salary acquired. They now have a TPE for X dollars plus $250k. The Team has 12 months ([or less if over the First Apron](#caveat)) to acquire additional players using this TPE without the need to send out more Outgoing Salary.\n\n**🏀** **Celtics Acquire Large TPE for Hayward**  \nIn 2020, the Celtics were able to obtain the largest TPE in history by sending Hayward via Sign-and-Trade to the Hornets. Because the Hornets were below the Salary Cap, they could have signed him outright. However, in the trade they absorbed his salary without any outgoing salary back to Boston in exchange for additional draft capital. A $28.5 million TPE was generated, allowing Boston to acquire Evan Fournier four months later. Similarly, Fournier was traded from the Celtics to the Knicks in a Sign-and-Trade creating yet another TPE, which was then used to acquire Derrick White.\n\n### The Time-Crunch Caveat\n\nThere is no Apron limitation to use the Standard TPE, generally. But if you are over the First Apron, your 12-month time limitation to use the TPE shortens to the following:\n\nIf the Standard TPE arose _during_ the Regular Season, then it expires at the conclusion of the current Regular Season.\n\nIf the Standard TPE arose _after_ the Regular Season and before the following Regular Season starts, then it expires after the day of that following Regular Season."

If you are looking to acquire more Trade Salary than you are sending out, then you must use the Expanded TPE, which is only available to Teams below the First Apron.\n\n**🏀** **Magic Aggregate Players to Acquire Bane**  \nThe Magic used the Aggregated TPE to aggregate the Trade Salary of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Cole Anthony to create enough Outgoing Trade Salary to absorb the Incoming Trade Salary of Desmond Dane.\n\nNote the Aggregated TPE is restricted to Teams below the Second Apron. So even if a Second Apron Team wants to aggregate players in one trade to obtain one player making _less_ money, they can’t do so.\n\n**🏀** **A Second Apron Hypothetical**  \nA Second Apron Team wants to trade Player A ($9.3 million) and Player B ($10.1 million), totaling $19.4 million, for one Player making $17 million to help cut costs. They can’t do so if they still are over the Second Apron after the Trade, because they are a Second Apron team restricted from aggregating Players in trade. Note, if it cuts enough Salary to drop the Team below the Second Apron, then they could use the Aggregated TPE, as it only matters where the Team lands _after_ the trade."

You can move on to “[Step 2 – Allocate Total Trade Bonus Amount](#allocate)” below.\n\nIf it is a Percentage-Based Trade Bonus, you need to follow the below steps to find the Total Trade Bonus Amount:\n\n### Total Base Compensation Owed (TBCO)\n\nWhen based on a percentage, you must calculate the total guaranteed [Base Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/basecompensation/) _remaining to be owed_ to the Player _as of the date of the trade_, excluding Option years (the **Total Base Compensation Owed**).\n\nOnce the Total Base Compensation Owed is found, you take the percentage from that to find the Total Trade Bonus Amount.\n\nBecause you find the Total Base Compensation Owed as of the date of the trade, the Current Season Base Compensation Owed changes on a daily basis throughout the Regular Season. \n\nTherefore, you must first determine the **Current Season Base Compensation Owed** as of the date of the trade, using the steps below:\n\n### Current Season Base Compensation Owed\n\nThe Current Season Base Compensation Owed can be tricky, as it adjusts on a daily basis once the Regular Season begins.\n\nTherefore, to determine the Current Season Base Compensation owed, you must first find the **Percent Regular Season Remaining**:\n\n**Regular Season Percentage – Before or After the Regular Season**:\n\n1. If the Trade occurs before the start of the Regular Season, then 100% of the Regular Season remains. Factor the entire guaranteed [Base Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/basecompensation/) for the current Season as part of the calculation.\n2. If the Trade occurs _after_ the Regular Season concludes, but before the new Salary Cap Year. Then 0% of the Regular Season remains. Exclude the current Season’s Salary from the Trade Bonus Calculation, because it is not “remaining to be owed.”\n\n**✍️** Note that you still include the current Season as part of the yearly allocation if the trade occurred prior to July 1st (i.e. the start of the new Salary Cap Year). More on this below. \n\n**Regular Season Percentage – During the Regular Season**:\n\nIf the Trade occurs during the Regular Season:\n\n1. Find the number of days that have elapsed from the start of the Regular Season (174 in 2025-26 ) to the date of the Trade. These are your **Days Elapsed**.\n2. Subtract Days Elapsed from Regular Season Days to find **Days Remaining**.\n3. Divide your Days Remaining by the total number of Regular Season Days in the Salary Cap Year. This is your **Percentage Elapsed**.\n4. Multiply the Player’s guaranteed [Base Compensation](https://cbaguide.com/contractanatomy/terms/compensation/basecompensation/) by this Percentage Elapsed to find the remaining amount owed for the current season to find the Current Season Based Compensation Owed.\n\n### Total Base Compensation Owed – All Seasons\n\nNext, add the Current Season Base Compensation Owed to the all guaranteed Base Compensation remaining over future Seasons, _excluding Option Years_.\n\nThis is the Player’s **Total Base Compensation Owed** (**TBCO**).\n\n### Multiply TBCO by the Percentage\n\nMultiply the Total Base Compensation Owed by the applicable percentage to find the Player’s **Total Trade Bonus Amount**.\n\nIf the Player had a “lesser of” condition between the percentage and a fixed amount, now you can determine whether the fixed amount is less than the percentage. Apply the proper Total Trade Bonus Amount.\n\nThis amount may be adjusted down if the yearly allocation exceeds the Maximum Salary.

Fernando was earning a non-guaranteed Salary of $2,425,403.  \n  \n$2,425,403 ÷ 174 = $13,939.10 Per-Day Cap Hit.  \n  \n$13,939.10 x 80 (days on Roster) = $1,115,128 in Dead Salary.\n\nNote that if a Player’s Salary is subsidized to 2 YOS Minimum Salary, you remove the subsidy should the Player get waived during the Season.\n\n**🏀** **Dozier’s Unsubsidized Salary Subject to Cap Hit**  \nIn 2024-25, Minnesota signed P.J. Dozier to a 1-year Minimum Contract. With 7 YOS, his Compensation was $2,613,120, but his Salary was subsidized to 2 YOS Minimum Salary of $2,087,519.  \n  \nOn December 28, 2024, Minnesota waived Dozier. Therefore, his Per-Day Cap Hit was calculated based on his unsubsidized Compensation: $2,613,120 ÷ 174 = $15,017.93.  \n  \n$15,017.93 x 70 (days elapsed) = $1,051,255 in Dead Salary.  \n  \n_Note Dozier had $1 million guaranteed. Had Dozier been waived earlier in the season where the Per-Day Cap Hit calculation was less then $1 million, then the $1 million would remain as Dead Salary._\n\nIf a Team does not want to incur a Per-Day Cap Hit, the Player must be waived by 5:00 P.M. two days prior to the first day of the Regular Season."

This is enough to sign him to his maximum. Without Cap Holds, the Celtics could use the $58 million to sign other Free Agents using cap space, and stay under the Salary Cap threshold.

If this rule didn’t apply, the Team could sign one player to an $8 million contract using Cap Space, and then use the Non-Taxpayer Midlevel Exception to sign another player to a $12 million contract. This rule eliminates this cap space manipulation. Since Team A’s cap space is less then the NTMLE, a Cap Hold is added for the NTMLE amount and the Team is considered over the Salary Cap.\n\n### When Applied\n\nThis Cap Hold is applied in the following circumstance:\n\n1. One or more [Salary Cap Exceptions](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/) are available to the Team; and\n2. Team Salary is below the [Salary Cap](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/) by less than the Exceptions available.\n3. then the amount of the Exception is included in the Team’s Team Salary until the Exception is actually used or until the Team is no longer entitled to the Exception.\n\nThe amount of the Exception is included in the Team’s Team Salary until the Exception is actually used or until the Team is no longer entitled to the Exception.\n\n**🏀** **Hypothetical When Cap Holds Apply**  \nTeam A is $18 million under the Salary Cap before Salary Cap Exception Cap Holds apply. Team A has the $14.1 million NTMLE and the $5.1 million Bi-Annual Exception available. Therefore, the Team is $1.2 million over the Salary Cap. If they want to sign one Player to an $18 million Contract, the Team can [renounce](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/teamsalary/#renouncing) their Exceptions and sign the Player using Cap Space.\n\n### Signings/DPE\n\nWhen an Exception is used to sign a Player, the Player’s Salary takes the place of the Cap Hold (any unused portion will remain if the rule above still applies). \n\nSimilarly, when a [DPE](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/#dpe) is used to sign or acquire a player, the Player’s acquired Salary takes the place of the DPE."

Then, Brackets 1 through 5 are the Prior Brackets._  \n  \n**Step 2 – Include all Tax Liability for Prior Brackets**  \nAdd the total Tax Liability found in all Prior Brackets.\n\n_For the hypothetical, since Team A’s Final Bracket is Bracket 6, Team A would include all of the Tax Liability in Brackets 1 through 5.The total amount for Brackets 1 through 5 is $89,538,750._  \n  \n**Step 3 – Determine How Much Tax Salary is in the Final Tax Bracket**  \nFind out how much Tax Salary remains in the Final Bracket. To find this, you subtract the threshold from the last Prior Bracket from the Tax Salary.\n\n_In our hypothetical. You subtract $218,000,000 (Tax Salary) by $216,320,000 (Bracket 5 threshold). This equals $1,680,000\\. This means there is $1,680,000 in remaining Tax Salary in the Final Bracket._  \n  \n**Step 4 – Multiply Remaining Amount by the Tax Rate in Final Bracket**  \nMultiply that remaining amount in the Final Bracket by its applicable Tax Rate.\n\n_In our hypothetical, multiply $1,680,000 by $5.75 (tax rate for Final Bracket, i.e. Bracket 6). This totals $9,660,000._\n\n**Step 5 – Add Tax Liability from Final Bracket to the Prior Brackets for Total Tax Liability**  \nTake the amount from Step 4 and add it to Step 2 and find the total Tax Liability for the Team.\n\nIn our hypothetical, add $89,538,750 (Prior Brackets Tax Liability) to $9,660,000 (Final Bracket Tax Liability) to find the Total Tax Liability of **$99,198,750**."

    "content": "### Purpose of Rule\n\nThis rule eliminates the Draftee’s ability to sign with another League and reenter the draft next year because he doesn’t like the Team that drafted him. If you sign with another professional team, then the Team that drafted you retains Draft Rights. Therefore, a Draftee’s only option would be to sit out of professional basketball altogether for an entire year.\n\n### Draft-and-Stash Strategy\n\nThis rule also leads to drafting-and-stashing players, which often takes place when a Team drafts a Player from overseas who isn’t ready to play in the NBA yet.\n\nIt allows the Team to draft the Player, retain his Draft Rights, but not have his Contract count toward their Team Salary while he continues to develop overseas.\n\n**🏀** **Micic Drafted in 2014, Signs in 2023**  \nIn 2014, the Philadelphia 76ers drafted Vasilije Micic with the 52nd pick in the Second Round. Philadelphia traded his Draft Rights to Oklahoma City in 2020\\. Oklahoma City then signed Micic to a 3-year Contract in the 2023 Offseason–nine years after being drafted. Micic played for two seasons before being bought out of his contract and returning to professional basketball overseas in Israel.\n\n### Triggering the Rule – A “Non-NBA Signing”\n\nIf the following elements occur, then the Non-NBA Contract Rules below apply:\n\n1. Drafted by NBA Team in Initial or Subsequent Draft;\n2. While the Team’s Draft Rights are triggered, the Draftee is already a party to or signs one of the following:  \n   * A Non-NBA professional basketball contract;  \n   * Player contract with a professional bball team or league not in the NBA;\n3. The Non-NBA Contract covers all or any part of the NBA Season immediately following the applicable Draft.\n\n### Non-NBA Contract Definition\n\nA Team or league that agrees via contract to pay money to Player (in excess of a stipend for living expenses) for rendering services to the Team/League.\n\n### Extension of Draft Rights\n\nWhen a Non-NBA Contract is signed triggering the rule, a Team retains its Draft Rights for one year from the _earlier_ of the following:\n\n1. The date the Draftee (i) has no legal impediment stopping him from signing and playing with the Drafting Team for the then-current season (if applicable) and (ii) the Draftee provides notice to the Team he is free to sign with the Team; or\n2. The date of the NBA Draft occurring in the 12-month period from August 1st to July 30th, provided the Player gives his intention and availability to play in the NBA for the then-current Season and there is no legal impediment to him doing so.\n\n### New Required Tender After Extension of Draft Rights\n\nIf the rule triggers an extension of Draft Rights, the Team must issue a Required Tender by August 10th the following year to retain its Draft Rights in Year 2.\n\nThe Team’s rights depend on whether the Draftee has new Non-NBA Contract obligations or not.\n\n### No New Non-NBA Obligations\n\nIf (i) by July 1st the Player notifies the Drafting Team that (i) by August 1st he will be under no contractual/legal impediment to sign and play immediately thereafter or for future Seasons (and that is indeed the case):\n\n* Tender Not Made – Failure to provide a timely Required Tender renders the Draftee a Rookie Free Agent;\n* Tender Made – If the Draftee does not sign the Required Tender, then the consequences depend on which Draft occurred:  \n   * Initial Draft – If it was the Player’s Initial Draft, then the next draft is the Subsequent Draft and you follow the rules regarding Draftees entering the [Subsequent Draft](#subsequentdraft);  \n   * Subsequent Draft – If it was the Player’s Subsequent Draft, he becomes a Rookie Free Agent when the Draft Rights expire.\n\n### New Non-NBA Obligation\n\nIf the Player enters into a new Non-NBA obligation, the following rules apply:\n\n1. If the Required Tender is made _or_ the Player makes no bona fide effort to negotiate, then the Drafting Team retains Draft Rights for another year, with the clock starting using the same method as the initial Exclusivity Period above.\n2. If the Player made a bona fide effort to negotiate _and_ no Required Tender was made, the Player becomes a Rookie Free Agent after the Team’s deadline to make the Required Tender.\n\n### Signing NBA Contract During NBA Regular Season\n\nIf a Player has a Non-NBA Contract, he can sign his [Rookie Scale Contract](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/signings/draftpicks/) from February 1st through June 30th to be effective beginning the following Season.\n\nThe Player is to receive the Rookie Scale Amount for the Season for which he signs. The Contract will state the percentage of the [Salary Cap](https://cbaguide.com/thresholds/salarycap/) the Draft Pick is to receive, rather than a fixed amount.\n\nNote that a Player can sign his [Rookie Scale Contract](https://cbaguide.com/transactions/signings/draftpicks/) while still under a non-NBA Contract, provided it expires prior to the effective date of the Rookie Scale Contract."
